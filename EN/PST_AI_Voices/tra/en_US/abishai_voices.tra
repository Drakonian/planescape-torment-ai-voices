// Abishai - 7 voice lines

@58136 = ~You see a red abishai. The creature is reptilian with a snake like-body, four clawed feet, leathery wings, and a draconian head. The scales covering its body are a dull shade of red. The creature stands upright on its hind legs, balancing with its prehensile tail. As you approach, its eyes narrow to slits and it begins to hiss.~ [AB58136V]
@58139 = ~The abishai glares at you and hisses in some guttural tongue. You realize it is not speaking to you when you hear a response from somewhere behind the abishai. After a moment it cocks its head to the side and hisses at you. "What want you?"~ [AB58139V]
@58142 = ~The abishai emits a series of hisses that are soon answered from the unknown source. "No... you ssspeak Tek'elach." It gestures vaguely behind it. "He agree talk you..."~ [AB58142V]
@58146 = ~The abishai glares at you for a moment before answering. "Tek'elach want talk you. Not I. You go."~ [AB58146V]
@58149 = ~You feel a wave of heat begin to emanate from the abishai as it leans in to talk to you. "You show respect... you be careful... I watch. I kill you if you do wrong." It displays rows of razor sharp teeth as it grins evilly at you. "You understand?"~ [AB58149V]
@58152 = ~The abishai hisses at you and reaches out to the nearby wall. Its eyes never leave yours as it digs several deep furrows into the stone with a single swipe of its claws. "Understand now? Or want up close, personal explanation?"~ [AB58152V]
@58155 = ~The abishai hisses at you angrily. "You told talk Tek'elach... go!"~ [AB58155V]
