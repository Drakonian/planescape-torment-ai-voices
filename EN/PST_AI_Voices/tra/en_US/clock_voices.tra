// Clock - 6 voice lines

@64225 = ~This huge clock looks like it has partially melted into the black stone surrounding it... but the ground around it has been disturbed, as if someone walked on it 'recently' - perhaps in the last few years.~ [CL64225V]
@64226 = ~There is something crudely scratched on the clock face, and you suddenly feel a strange, crawling sensation worming its way through the back of your skull - you know what's written on the clock is a message to you... from you.~ [CL64226V]
@64227 = ~The message carved on the clock face looks like it was carved with a dagger:   RUN - DOORS are LIES - USE Cannons - then PORTAL  It looks like the message was written in some haste. Following the message is a crude 'arrow' pointing in the opposite direction as the long hand on the clock.~ [CL64227V]
@64228 = ~This huge clock looks like it has partially melted into the black stone surrounding it... but the ground around it has been disturbed, as if someone walked on it 'recently' - perhaps in the last few years. On its surface is the message from yourself... to you.~ [CL64228V]
@64234 = ~This huge clock looks like it has partially melted into the black stone surrounding it... as you look at the clock face, you suddenly feel a strange, crawling sensation worming its way through the back of your skull - you've seen a clock like this before, but not this one. There's something important about it, but you don't know what.~ [CL64234V]
@64235 = ~This huge clock looks like it has partially melted into the black stone surrounding it... unlike the other clock with the message, however, this clock face bears no messages or marks. Apparently, your previous incarnation never came across this one.~ [CL64235V]
