@53237 = ~You see a frightened Curst citizen. "Thank you for your help... I don't know what I would have done... they would have killed me..." He babbles his thanks for a time, and then, "I ought to help. This city's in no shape for me to be selfish. Thank you, again and again. Farewell."~ [CS53237V]
