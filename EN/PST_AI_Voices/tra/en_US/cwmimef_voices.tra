@49739 = ~This young woman - observing some sort of performance artist - looks somewhat puzzled. She turns your way as you draw near.~ [CW49739V]
@49742 = ~"I've never seen anything quite like it. I find his act annoying, yet oddly interesting, at the same time."~ [CW49742V]
@49746 = ~She continues to watch the man, who appears to be trapped in an invisible box or cage. "Another time, sir. Please leave me be for the moment."~ [CW49746V]
@49750 = ~The woman shoots you an annoyed glance. "Despite what *you* might think, sir, I don't care to be harassed on the street by a stranger's questions. Now leave me be!"~ [CW49750V]
@49753 = ~"I'm not certain I understand it, myself. This man's act involved all sorts of impersonations and physical comedy, but he never spoke a word. Earlier, a passing mage walked by and the artists mimicked his unusual gait. The mage, angered, cursed him... I think the man can no longer speak, and seems trapped in the same invisible box he earlier pretended to be confined within. He was quite panicked, at first, but seems to have calmed himself and continues with his act."~ [CW49753V]
