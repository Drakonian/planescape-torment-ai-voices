@49756 = ~This gentleman is closely watching some sort of performance artist, a confused expression upon his face.~ [CW49756V]
@49759 = ~The man turns to you, but the performance artist still holds most of his attention. "Odd, no? Poor fellow."~ [CW49759V]
@49763 = ~He continues to watch the silent, black-garbed man, shaking his head in response to you. "Not now, sir, please. Farewell."~ [CW49763V]
@49767 = ~"Really, sir, come now. I'm sure there are many people you can speak with rather than me. Leave me to watch this in peace, will you? Farewell."~ [CW49767V]
@49770 = ~"Well you see... that man is a performance artist. His act consisted of various silent impersonations, both of physical actions - pulling on a rope, being trapped in an invisible box - and of passersby. He happened to mock a passing mage's unusual walk and now seems to be cursed: he actually *is* trapped in an invisible box, now, and cannot speak. Ironic, no?"~ [CW49770V]
