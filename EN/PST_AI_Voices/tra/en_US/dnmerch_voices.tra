@50999 = ~You see a skeleton bouncing from the ball of one foot to another. Air whistles from between its teeth. It looks very, very bored. At your approach, its demeanor changes entirely. "Welcome, welcome! I've got a host of items for your perusal, fresh from the latest berks who've been trying to loot the quiet ones. Would you like to see them?"~ [DN50999V]
@51004 = ~He sighs. "Look, I know I've got eternity to stand around and gossip until the cows come home, but the truth is I don't like dealing with the living, all right? I take this stuff from the living before they die and I sell it to other deaders, so if it's all the same to you, I'd rather just conclude the transaction and go home, all right? So. You want to see what I have? Fine. I'll show it to you. Otherwise, leave me alone."~ [DN51004V]
@51007 = ~"Oh. You again. What do you want now?"~ [DN51007V]
@51011 = ~"No." He looks around behind you. "I'd rather stare at the wall, frankly." He looks back at you. "Are you going to buy something or not?"~ [DN51011V]
@51035 = ~"Good day, then." He continues to whistle tunelessly behind his white, white teeth.~ [DN51035V]
@51037 = ~The merchant looks unimpressed, despite the clamor of the area. "Come to put me down then, eh? Go ahead. I don't care."~ [DN51037V]
@51041 = ~"Of course not. I died horribly a long time ago. I'm not worried about anything you could possibly do to me. Pain means nothing. All I have now is consciousness, and I don't value that so highly that I'll fight you for it."~ [DN51041V]
