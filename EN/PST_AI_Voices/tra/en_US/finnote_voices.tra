@50380 = ~As you read over Fin Andlye's notes regarding the lost language of the Uyo, there is a throbbing sensation in your temples as a memory begins to surface... memories of this language.  You recall letters, words, phrases, until - like a Spire-wind blowing away the blanket of poisonous smog over the Great Foundry - the language is once more revealed to you in its entirety. You should be able to read the writing in the dodecahedron, now.~ [FI50380V]
