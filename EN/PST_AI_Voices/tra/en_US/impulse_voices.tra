@52690 = ~This huge crystal radiates a pulsating, spectral light as it hovers above the crater in the middle of the room. The rhythm of its pulses remind you of a heartbeat, but slow and sickly. Light from the crystal touches the edges of the room like fingers, each ray of light casting a glow on the ruined faces of the statues surrounding it.~ [IM52690V]
@59895 = ~There is a moment of dizziness as you touch the crystal; then a slow chill passes through your body, and you discover that your muscles have locked, your hand frozen to the crystal's surface. There is a moment of silence, then sharp pains splinter through your body like fractures - you feel as if your very BEING has been turned to ice, then *shattered*...~ [IM59895V]
@64590 = ~As you touch the crystal, there is a flash of heat, an orange-white light, and you whip your hand back - the crystal burns, like the heat from Ignus' flames. From within the crystal, the sickly white-blue light dances and flickers like fire.~ [IM64590V]
@64592 = ~As you touch the crystal, there is a sudden chill, a bright white light, and you whip your hand back - the crystal is like ice, like the chill from Vhailor's armor. From within the crystal, the sickly white-blue light blinks, like the eye of some great beast.~ [IM64592V]
