// Morte - 754 voice lines

@986 = ~"Hey, chief. You okay? You playing corpse or you putting the blinds on the Dusties? I thought you was a deader for sure."~ [MO0986V]
@990 = ~"Me?" The skull seems indignant. "How about *you* start, scabbie? Who are you?"~ [MO0990V]
@996 = ~"Oh, so *now* you want to talk to Morte again, huh?"~ [MO0996V]
@997 = ~"You don't know who you are, huh? You *could* have just said, 'pike it, berk.' Well, that's okay... pretend you're a Clueless. See if I give a fig. I'm Morte. Hail, well met and all that wash."~ [MO0997V]
@999 = ~"You don't *remember?* Musta been some night you had. Better hope you didn't hurt anybody... the name's Morte. Hail, well met, and all that wash." He pauses for a moment. "Say, I *have* to ask: are you one of those Sensates into self-mutilation or did somebody give you those scars?"~ [MO0999V]
@1003 = ~"Yeah, 'an I asked you second. What's your name?"~ [MO1003V]
@1008 = ~"Man, you're tighter than a wet rope. All right, all right... *I'll* be the nice guy here... me, I'm Morte. Morte Rictusgrin. Now what name is unfortunate enough to have you as its owner?"~ [MO1008V]
@1012 = ~"You're in this dump called the Mortuary... it's this big black structure with all the architectural charm of a pregnant spider."~ [MO1012V]
@1014 = ~"Well, now I don't know about that... but the Mortuary's the closest thing to a morgue you're gonna find in this berg. Berks haul dead bodies here, bury 'em, burn 'em, and if you're *really* lucky, you get brought back to life as a slave. Not the best spot on the planes to be. If I was you, I'd dig up the nearest exit and give this place the laugh."~ [MO1014V]
@1021 = ~Pauses. "Yeah, I guess. Maybe some waster thought you was a deader and dropped you off. Yer corpse act sure had *me* fooled... maybe you should find the berk who dragged you here and put the questions to him, eh?" Morte nods. "Not bad thinking for a recently dead guy... good to see your brain-box is still in one piece."~ [MO1021V]
@1022 = ~"Yeah, it's a charmed life... except for the near-constant application of formaldehyde and stitching your limbs back when they fall off, it's paradise."~ [MO1022V]
@1023 = ~"Uh... like I said, the Mortuary. You okay, chief? You don't look too good."~ [MO1023V]
@1024 = ~"Chief, from where I'm sitting, you crawling off that slab was beating the odds. You look like you're about to settle your drinking tab, if you catch my meaning."~ [MO1024V]
@1025 = ~"Don't know what Sensates are? Oh, are *you* in for a treat! They're this group of bashers who're all about experiencing all the planes have to offer, right, including... well, forget it for now. What about those scars?"~ [MO1025V]
@1026 = ~"It's like some basher decided to paint you with a knife. You're scarred all over... even on your back, 'cept..." Pauses. "Say, you got a whole tattoo gallery on your back, berk. Spells out something..."~ [MO1026V]
@1031 = ~"Some people in this berg collect deaders off the street and sell 'em here for jink. Not a great way to make ends meet, but when ye're living in the chamber pot of the planes, yer options are pretty narrow."~ [MO1031V]
@1034 = ~"Eh... money. Jink is money. Didn't they have that where you came from?"~ [MO1034V]
@1037 = ~He pauses. "Don't know. You're *talking* to me... the walking dead around here don't usually do that. As I see it, the Dusties made a mistake and you weren't dead. Did you sign some sort of contract that you remember? I mean, they usually gotta fill out all sorts of legal paperwork before they can pull someone outta the dead-book."~ [MO1037V]
@1042 = ~"Yeah, the 'dead-book.' You know? Uh, maybe you don't. Look, forget the 'dead-book.' You're alive, so you ain't in it."~ [MO1042V]
@1043 = ~"Yeah, don't it make you want to split bricks? Law makes Sigil spin, and you can't even empty your bladder without filling out one contract or another."~ [MO1043V]
@1044 = ~"By every god and his mother, are *you* out of it. Do you have any idea where you came from? Somewhere, a nation of Clueless is missing their king. Did you bite your thumb at a god or were you always this ignorant?"~ [MO1044V]
@1045 = ~"Chief, I have no sodding idea. You sure got the knack for playing dead, though. While you was lying there, I never saw your chest move, your eyes blink... nothing. Were you drinking? Is that what happened?"~ [MO1045V]
@1046 = ~"Well, now that *is* a good question. Sand's running through the glass for you, chief. The Dustmen find you, they'll attempt to correct your resurrection 'problem' by tossing you in the crematorium. If you keep playing dead, you'll go to the crematorium anyway. A modron's choice, eh? What to do?"~ [MO1046V]
@1052 = ~"Oh, *good* idea, chief! Why didn't *I* think of that? How you gonna escape, huh? I'll give you a clue: It involves a little cooperation."~ [MO1052V]
@1055 = ~"From where I'm sitting, it's obvious you need to get out of here. Me, I can afford to wait. The only danger *I'm* in is dying of boredom. We could lend each other a hand."~ [MO1055V]
@1061 = ~"It may not look it, but I could help you outta here, and you could help me outta here. I haven't got hands, so I'm in a bit of a quandary. You're missing what's in your cranium, while I got plenty of experience and know-how to get you out of this dive. We cooperate, and we both come out a *head.* Deal, berk?"~ [MO1061V]
@1064 = ~"Oh, *good* idea, chief! Why didn't *I* think of that?" His tone becomes mocking. "By the way, Sir Dustman, I died and woke up on a slab in your little Mortuary. Can you please help me?" "They'll 'help' you all right. They'll look at you for a few seconds, call the guards and pop you in your own private kiln."~ [MO1064V]
@1068 = ~"Just trust me... it doesn't matter how tough you think you are or what you say to them, they'll get you. You ain't strong enough to break out of a walled-in tomb or survive the heat of the Elemental Plane of Fire. Waking up from the dead is bad enough as far as the caretakers around here are concerned. Don't be an idiot."~ [MO1068V]
@1071 = ~"Fate can go squat on a halberd for all I care. Listen, chief. Pay attention to how often 'bad' and 'fate' show up in the same sentence, and you'll catch on to one of life's little mysteries. Best thing to do is to tell fate to wrap itself in razorvine; there's *always* another option that fate never lets on."~ [MO1071V]
@1072 = ~"Awright then... now, c'mon, let's give this place the laugh. The doors outta here are locked, so we'll need the key. Chances are, one of the walking corpses in this room has it."~ [MO1072V]
@1082 = ~"The Dusties? They watch the place here. You can't miss them... they have an obsession with black and rigor mortis of the face. They call themselves 'the Dustmen' and pretend they're a faction, but they're just an addled bunch of ghoulish death-worshippers. Steer clear of them."~ [MO1082V]
@1091 = ~"Yeah? Like *what* questions?"~ [MO1091V]
@1100 = ~"You don't remember *anything?* C'mon, that's a load of tanar'ri dung. You serious?"~ [MO1100V]
@1104 = ~"By every god and his mother... well, chief, more than likely your memories just took a dive into your brain-box. With any luck, they'll come up for air soon, trust me. Musta been some night you had. Better hope you didn't hurt anybody or mix it up with the law... say, speaking of which, are you one of those Sensates into self-mutilation or did somebody give you those scars?"~ [MO1104V]
@1117 = ~"Looks like directions..." Morte clears his throat. "Let's see. It starts with..."  NOTE: "I know you feel like you've been drinking a few kegs of Styx wash, but you need to center yourself. Among your possessions should be a JOURNAL that'll shed some light on the dark of the matter. PHAROD should be able to fill you in on the rest of the chant, if he's not in the dead-book already.   Don't lose this scrap of flesh OR the journal or we'll be up the Styx again, right? And trust me, whatever you do, DO NOT tell anyone WHO you are, WHAT happens to you, or WHERE you came from or you'll find yourself on a short trip to the crematorium."~ [MO1117V]
@1123 = ~"No... you were stripped to the skins when you arrived here. 'Sides, looks like you got enough of a journal written on your body."~ [MO1123V]
@1128 = ~"Nobody I know. Then again, I don't know many people. Still, some berk's got to know where to find this guy... once we get out of here, that is."~ [MO1128V]
@1818 = ~"What good fortune! We probably lost what we're looking for back at your kip, miss."~ [MO1818V]
@1844 = ~"Chief, can you sport me some jink... it's... eh... been a long time, it has."~ [MO1844V]
@2000 = ~"She means money."~ [MO2000V]
@2048 = ~"It's just as well neither you nor your tail are for sale. You couldn't squeak out a living with 'em, anyway."~ [MO2048V]
@2067 = ~"She's a tiefling, chief. They got some demon's blood in 'em, and that makes 'em paranoid and defensive... nice tail, though. Shame it's plastered on such an ugly body."~ [MO2067V]
@2074 = ~"Why don't you *try* and split my jaw, chit?! All I'm hearing is a lotta chatter from some Hive trash! Throw a punch! I dare you! I'll bite your legs off!"~ [MO2074V]
@2079 = ~"Mimir's a talking encyclopedia. That's me, chief."~ [MO2079V]
@2348 = ~"Give it up, chief. Talking to a gith is like trying to make good with razorvine. Let's go."~ [MO2348V]
@2349 = ~"Yeah, a 'gith'..." Morte glances at the gith, who is still staring at you. "We'll talk about it some other time."~ [MO2349V]
@2354 = ~"I wouldn't bother trying to talk square to ol' Ignorance-is-Bliss here. Let's get outta here, chief."~ [MO2354V]
@2601 = ~"Psssst. You see the way she was looking at me? Huh? You see that? The way she was following the curve of my occipital bone?"~ [MO2601V]
@2604 = ~"Wha- are you BLIND?! She was scouting me out! It was shameless the way she WANTED me."~ [MO2604V]
@2609 = ~"Yeah, yeah, whatever. When you've been dead as long as I have, you know the signals. They may be too SUBTLE for you to pick up on, but that's why I'll be spending MY nights with some luscious recently-dead chit while you're standing around goin' 'huh?' 'Whatzz goin' on?' 'Where's my muh-muh-memories?'"~ [MO2609V]
@2611 = ~"You? Yeah, right! Trust me, chits beyond the grave don't care about all that 'physicality' and 'I've got a body' and 'I'm all scarred and tough-looking.' They want guys with SPIRIT. That's me, chief. You? Corpses like YOU are as common as copper."~ [MO2611V]
@2709 = ~"What? What is it? Is this chit bothering you?"~ [MO2709V]
@2711 = ~"I believe it. Maybe he'd better return to your main menu and leave me out of it."~ [MO2711V]
@2782 = ~"Oh, for the powers' sake! Piking dabus."~ [MO2782V]
@2788 = ~"He's a dabus. They 'speak' in rebuses, these annoying word puzzles. If *you* don't know what he's saying, then we better find a native or some other way to communicate with him... if we want to. An annoying bunch. My bet? They *can* speak, they just would rather piss everyone else off by trying to puzzle out what they're saying."~ [MO2788V]
@2789 = ~"Chant is they're janitors for the Lady of Pain. They float around breaking, fixing and patching up Sigil according to her whims. They're worse than corpse flies." Morte sighs. "You can't swat 'em though, or the Lady'll get... upset."~ [MO2789V]
@3473 = ~"I think the Dustie chit might be a bit short of hearing, chief. Let's lay off, shall we?"~ [MO3473V]
@3477 = ~"Eh... she's a *tiefling,* chief. They got fiend blood in their veins, usually 'cause some ancestor of theirs shared knickers with one demon or another. Makes some of 'em addled in the head... and addled-looking, too."~ [MO3477V]
@3480 = ~"I think the Dustie chit might be a bit short of hearing, chief. Let's lay off, shall we?"~ [MO3480V]
@3481 = ~"Eh... she's a *tiefling,* chief. They got a dash of fiend blood running in their veins, usually 'cause some ancestor of theirs shared knickers with some demon or another. Makes some of 'em addled in the head... and usually addled-looking, too."~ [MO3481V]
@3487 = ~"Looks like you have a new friend, chief. You two need some time together, or...?"~ [MO3487V]
@3492 = ~"This may be the second time in my life I'm thankful I don't have a nose."~ [MO3492V]
@3870 = ~"Hey! Hey! What are you doing?"~ [MO3870V]
@3873 = ~"If you're going to rattle your bone-box with Dusties, leave me outta it. Me and them aren't gonna be best bloods... and you shouldn't try and be family with them either. They'd sooner torch or bury you than bend an ear. Don't be barmy; let's just get out of here."~ [MO3873V]
@3876 = ~"Hey! Are you deaf? What are you doing?"~ [MO3876V]
@3879 = ~"*Don't* listen to me then - it's your funeral."~ [MO3879V]
@3964 = ~"Whoa, chief. That's vandalism. Those bolts are probably the only thing holding that bag of bones together. Necromancy only goes so far with these old fellas, y'know?"~ [MO3964V]
@3968 = ~"Oh, it's not a problem." Morte does a strange bobbing motion that you think might be a shrug. "Just wasn't sure if you knew that or not. By all means, go ahead."~ [MO3968V]
@3974 = ~"Hmmmm. Wonder if this graybeard would mind if *I* borrowed his body..."~ [MO3974V]
@3978 = ~"Graybeard... you know, geezer, old feller, yellow dog... old."~ [MO3978V]
@3981 = ~Morte studies the skeleton for a moment, then shakes his head. "Nah... I'd need a fresher one than this. And something with a little more dignity... this one's all creaky and fractured."~ [MO3981V]
@3984 = ~"Oh, you're a sackfull of laughs." Morte glares at you. "Besides, YOU'RE one to talk, berk. Mirrors beg for mercy when you're around."~ [MO3984V]
@3987 = ~Morte snorts. You're not quite sure how he managed it without lungs.~ [MO3987V]
@3990 = ~"Helping you escape the preparation room has now been added to my growing list of regrets." Morte snorts again. "I should have let you rot... more, that is."~ [MO3990V]
@4018 = ~Morte grins.~ [MO4018V]
@4020 = ~"Oh... sorry." Morte floats up to the head of the skeleton, stares at it, then floats back down, studying the armor and the blade as he descends. "Oh, yes. Yes, yes, I think this'll do."~ [MO4020V]
@4021 = ~"Then what in Baator did you ASK me if I wanted it for, then? Practicing your cruelty skills?" Morte bobs indignantly. "And after all I've done for you..."~ [MO4021V]
@4022 = ~Morte stares at you for a moment. "What, did we get MARRIED at some point? What's all this 'I don't want you to get hurt' wash?" Morte glares at you. "If you REALLY cared, you'd find a way to get my head on that giant skeleton's body."~ [MO4022V]
@4134 = ~"Hey! Hey! What are you doing?"~ [MO4134V]
@4135 = ~"If you're going to rattle your bone-box with Dusties, leave me outta it. Me and them aren't gonna be best bloods... and you shouldn't try and be family with them either. They'd sooner torch or bury you than bend an ear. Don't be barmy; let's just get out of here."~ [MO4135V]
@4136 = ~"Hey! Are you deaf? What are you doing?"~ [MO4136V]
@4137 = ~"*Don't* listen to me then - it's your funeral."~ [MO4137V]
@4338 = ~"Hey! Hey! What are you doing?"~ [MO4338V]
@4341 = ~"If you're going to rattle your bone-box with Dusties, leave me outta it. Me and them aren't gonna be best bloods... and you shouldn't try and be family with them either. They'd sooner torch or bury you than bend an ear. Don't be barmy; let's just get out of here."~ [MO4341V]
@4344 = ~"Hey! Are you deaf? What are you doing?"~ [MO4344V]
@4347 = ~"*Don't* listen to me then - it's your funeral."~ [MO4347V]
@4675 = ~Morte breaks in, whispering. "By the powers... this berk's an *Anarchist.* Posing as a zombie's got to be a first for those addled sods."~ [MO4675V]
@4677 = ~"Anarchists... they're a faction..." Morte looks like he's about to let loose a torrent of insults, then notices the zombie staring at you both, listening intently. "...they, uh, want to *liberate* everyone from the chains of government. Tear down the old, establish a new order with no order at all."~ [MO4677V]
@4683 = ~Whispers: "He's wondering if you're crazy, loco, a cackle, addled... and so am I. Now stow the 'I woke up from the dead' talk, willya?! Ye're embarrassing me."~ [MO4683V]
@4688 = ~Morte sighs. "Look, chief... you gotta get your wits about you. You can't go around telling everybody the TRUTH all the time. We can't have every cony-catcher we meet taking us for marks, right?"~ [MO4688V]
@4692 = ~"Hold on..." Morte sounds surprised. "This berk must be an *Anarchist.* Heh. Posing as a zombie's got to be a first for those addled sods."~ [MO4692V]
@4694 = ~"Anarchists... they're a faction that wastes their time peeping on authority figures and looking for ways to tear down anything that stinks of order or control." Morte snorts. "The Anarchists think every berk across the planes'll be free and happy to seek out their own 'truth' once the establishment is burned to the ground. They want to establish a new order - no order at all."~ [MO4694V]
@4700 = ~"He's saying this Pharod berk has been selling a lot of deaders... corpses... to the Dustmen. That's what Collectors do: they gather dead bodies and sell them to the Dustmen. Sounds like this Pharod's been selling so many deaders that the Dusties think he's been putting Hivers in the dead-book before their hour's up... y'know, killing people."~ [MO4700V]
@4703 = ~"He wants to know if somebody robbed you. Probably what happened."~ [MO4703V]
@4706 = ~"Yeah, *they're* the stupid ones all right."~ [MO4706V]
@4708 = ~"I can't believe you're going through with this. How barmy ARE you?"~ [MO4708V]
@4710 = ~"Can't you make the stitches on his lips any tighter?"~ [MO4710V]
@5029 = ~"Hey! Hey! What are you doing?"~ [MO5029V]
@5032 = ~"If you're going to rattle your bone-box with Dusties, leave me outta it. Me and them aren't gonna be best bloods... and you shouldn't try and be family with them either. They'd sooner torch or bury you than bend an ear. Don't be barmy; let's just get out of here."~ [MO5032V]
@5035 = ~"Hey! Are you deaf? What are you doing?"~ [MO5035V]
@5038 = ~"*Don't* listen to me then - it's your funeral."~ [MO5038V]
@5041 = ~"What are you *doing?!* If you're gonna kill him, do it!"~ [MO5041V]
@5043 = ~"At least he *can* walk." Morte snorts. "Floating around loses its thrill as soon as you want to kick somebody."~ [MO5043V]
@5049 = ~"Whoa, chief! What are you doing?!"~ [MO5049V]
@5052 = ~"Look, rattling your bone-box with Dusties should be the LAST thing-"~ [MO5052V]
@5053 = ~"And we *especially* shouldn't be swapping the chant with sick Dusties. C'mon, let's leave. The quicker we give this place the laugh, the bet-"~ [MO5053V]
@6071 = ~"You back with me, chief? You kind of drifted out on me there."~ [MO6071V]
@6072 = ~"Eh? Spirit?"~ [MO6072V]
@6073 = ~"You were rattling your bone-box with some woman? Where?" Morte looks around, excited. "What did she look like?"~ [MO6073V]
@6074 = ~"Eh... no, you just kind of drifted out for a bit there, just stood there, statue-like. I was a little worried you'd gone addled on me again."~ [MO6074V]
@6324 = ~"Reminds me of a job I once had." He seems embarrassed. "Well, I mean... without the arms."~ [MO6324V]
@6609 = ~"Whoa, chief. That's vandalism. Those bolts are probably the only thing holding that bag of bones together. Necromancy only goes so far with these old fellas, y'know?"~ [MO6609V]
@6610 = ~"Hmmmm. Wonder if this graybeard would mind if *I* borrowed his body..."~ [MO6610V]
@6611 = ~"Would you cut that out? His arms are gonna snap off."~ [MO6611V]
@6771 = ~"She runs this city. You'll know if you see her: She's got these blades around her face, she's about the size of a giant, and she floats off the ground, just like these guys." Morte nods at the dabus, who is looking at you both. "Nobody knows much about her... she doesn't speak much. All you need to know is that you don't want to make her angry. If you see her, my advice: run."~ [MO6771V]
@6784 = ~Morte scoffs. "I'd sooner be strained through a tanar'ri's bowels than unravel what these floating goat-heads are trying to say. You want a translator? Find a Sigil native."~ [MO6784V]
@6786 = ~"Oh, they *have* names. I'm sure of it."~ [MO6786V]
@6790 = ~"So *you* say, fiendling."~ [MO6790V]
@6794 = ~Morte scoffs. "I'd sooner be strained through a tanar'ri's bowels than unravel what these floating goat-heads are trying to say. You want a translator? Get the fiendling chit here to do it." He nods at Annah. "She's a Hive native."~ [MO6794V]
@6797 = ~Morte scoffs. "I'd sooner be strained through a tanar'ri's bowels than unravel what these floating goat-heads are trying to say. You want a translator?" He nods at Dak'kon. "Get holier-than-thou-and-twice-as-silent here to translate."~ [MO6797V]
@6800 = ~Morte scoffs. "I'd sooner be strained through a tanar'ri's bowels than unravel what these floating goat-heads are trying to say. You want a translator? Get the tanar'ri to do it." He nods at Fall-from-Grace. "She's probably had to trade the chant with these guys all the time."~ [MO6800V]
@7040 = ~As you turn away, you notice Morte staring at you. "Eh? Eh?"~ [MO7040V]
@7041 = ~"Did you *see* the way that cadaverous beauty was staring at me?" Morte's teeth chatter, as if in anticipation. "She was looking for some lucky cutter to thaw her coffin."~ [MO7041V]
@7042 = ~Morte ignores you and becomes thoughtful. "I don't really mind the attention, actually... it's just that I like to be seen as something more than just a skull, y'know? I have feelings that go beyond my base animal instincts. I want courtship, not some fortnight fling around the mausoleum."~ [MO7042V]
@7043 = ~"Whoa, chief..." Morte backs slightly out of arm's reach. "Women, they appreciate lovers, not fighters."~ [MO7043V]
@7044 = ~"Yeah, well, I may be just a skull, but I've got a big heart."~ [MO7044V]
@7045 = ~"What, were you dumped into my life to spit on my dreams and aspirations?! Fine, be that way, then. I don't have a heart, but I *do* have a soul."~ [MO7045V]
@7046 = ~"If you had half the sense you died with, you'd know better." Morte's voice rises to new heights of smugness. "When it comes to the annals of love, I wrote 'em all."~ [MO7046V]
@7071 = ~Morte studies the skeleton for a moment, then shakes his head. "Nah... this one's too clean... there's barely any meat left on him at all. Plus, I'd never be able to get all that whitewash off the bones."~ [MO7071V]
@7130 = ~"Yeah!"~ [MO7130V]
@7187 = ~"Mimir's a talking encyclopedia. That's me, chief."~ [MO7187V]
@7775 = ~"Whoa, chief." Morte cuts in before you can speak to the creature. "Bar that. You don't want to be rattling your bone-box with any fiend on the street. Leave be."~ [MO7775V]
@7778 = ~"No you don't." Morte glances at the creature, then turns back to you and lowers his voice to a whisper. "They're touchy. Let's just go."~ [MO7778V]
@7805 = ~Morte sighs as you are about to speak to the creature.~ [MO7805V]
@7807 = ~"Oh, nothing... life is the best teacher, you know." He nods at the creature. "Go ahead."~ [MO7807V]
@9860 = ~"C'mon, chief... you'll kill the sod before you manage to wake him!"~ [MO9860V]
@11946 = ~Morte floats over. "What's the chant, chief?"~ [MO11946V]
@11947 = ~Morte glances at your palm. "Yechhhh." He seems morbidly fascinated. "Ugly little berks, aren't they?"~ [MO11947V]
@11948 = ~"Bar that." Morte shudders. "Would you want those things in *you?*"~ [MO11948V]
@11949 = ~"Those little pikers better not come anywhere near me, or I'll..." Morte pauses. "You know, I have no idea how to threaten teeth."~ [MO11949V]
@11950 = ~The struggle is brief. You catch Morte in a headlock - the only move you can really do - and as he attempts to bite his way free, the teeth hop out of your hand and swarm onto his jaw. Morte howls as Ingress' teeth promptly rip out his old teeth and then jump into the exposed cavities.~ [MO11950V]
@11951 = ~Morte continues howling. The teeth settle in, adjusting themselves and planting their roots with a horrid drilling noise.~ [MO11951V]
@11952 = ~Morte doesn't seem to hear you... he keeps howling and howling, then suddenly starts smashing his teeth together. He gets in three powerful bites before the upper and lower teeth lock together and prevent him from opening his mouth.~ [MO11952V]
@11953 = ~Morte mumbles something at you, his eyes wide.~ [MO11953V]
@11954 = ~The teeth suddenly unlock, and Morte takes a deep breath. "I will *kill* you for this," he says. "That was a dirty thing to do."~ [MO11954V]
@11955 = ~Morte moves his jaw around experimentally. "Odd. But not bad." Suddenly, the teeth extend into fangs. "Ooooooh! They change!" They shrink down to normal, then fangs again, then normal... "I think I'm going to like these."~ [MO11955V]
@11956 = ~"Oh, I'll still get you for this," Morte replies. He grins, his teeth turning into fangs again. "Just you wait."~ [MO11956V]
@11957 = ~"What's wrong?" Morte floats in closer and glances at your palm. "Hey... they look like they're planning something, don't they?"~ [MO11957V]
@11958 = ~What happens next is difficult to describe... and painful to watch. Faster than you can close your palm, the teeth hop out of your hand and swarm onto Morte's jaw. Morte howls as Ingress' teeth promptly rip out his old teeth and then jump into the exposed cavities.~ [MO11958V]
@11959 = ~The teeth suddenly unlock, and Morte takes a deep breath. "I will *kill* you for this! You planned that! I know it!"~ [MO11959V]
@12389 = ~Morte whispers to you: "Boss, I don't like this. They're not supposed to be here. The Blood War hasn't kicked the celestials' asses bad enough that any fiend can go on furlough. They *want* something. Tread carefully." In the meantime, Tegar'in continues to respond to its companion...~ [MO12389V]
@12449 = ~"Boss, I'm more sure than ever that these berks ain't on the up and up. Sounds to me like they deserted, like they're looking for some angle that'll elevate their status in Baator. You don't want to be talking to 'em, boss... you don't know what game they're playing, and you could get burned... literally."~ [MO12449V]
@12466 = ~Morte floats close to whisper in your ear: "He *is* right, chief... I don't know what's got you all riled up."~ [MO12466V]
@12467 = ~"Yeah, yeah! The good stuff!"~ [MO12467V]
@12621 = ~Morte seems taken aback as all eyes fall on him. "What? What?" You get the impression that, had he lips, he'd be whistling innocently.~ [MO12621V]
@12622 = ~"Well, I say we hear this man out. Yeah?" Morte turns and stares hard at the rat-catcher.~ [MO12622V]
@12623 = ~Morte rolls his eyes, as if embarrassed. "It's a... talking encyclopedia. Not something I'm proud of. Now, let's hear this fellow out, all right?"~ [MO12623V]
@12624 = ~"Oh c'mon, chief... why would I hold out on you? I've told you everything useful *I* know. Let's just get this berk's take on the whole thing."~ [MO12624V]
@12625 = ~"Yeah, chief! That's the spirit!"~ [MO12625V]
@12626 = ~"Dead, chief... dead."~ [MO12626V]
@12627 = ~"Dead, chief... dead."~ [MO12627V]
@13748 = ~"Well, that's a tree with one snapped branch too many." Morte rolls his eyes. "No sense in chatting with Xaositects, chief. They're a barmy bunch."~ [MO13748V]
@13749 = ~"They're a 'faction' who don't have any rules... except don't keep one thought in their head for too long. They're sometimes called 'Chaosmen.' No need to explain why."~ [MO13749V]
@13750 = ~"They just seem to attract members like flies... well, members that are crazy or chaotic enough, I suppose. I don't think they have any recruiters... though you really can't say anything about them for sure."~ [MO13750V]

@14075 = ~"All rightie then..." Morte hisses at you. "Let's go, chief. This Dustie might as well be fertilizer."~ [MO14075V]
@15339 = ~"Tear that candied fop in two, boss! Show him how it's done!"~ [MO15339V]
@15340 = ~"Yeah, answer the questions!"~ [MO15340V]
@15341 = ~"I'll put ten copper on the big, scarred guy!" Morte floats close and whispers: "Eh, that's you, chief. Don't let us down, here."~ [MO15341V]
@15342 = ~"All right, chief: you've got him this time! Fight dirty!"~ [MO15342V]
@15343 = ~"That's right, you pompous, perfumed, candied-arse elitist... you heard him!"~ [MO15343V]
@15344 = ~"Who am *I?* Hah! I could've been your father but that monkey beat me up the stairs!"~ [MO15344V]
@15345 = ~"What's wrong, princess? At a loss for words? You'd best lift that dropped jaw before something flies down your throat! That's right, you heard me! Pack up your frilly brassiere and go hide beneath your mother's filthy skirt, where you belong! And tell her I said hello while you're at it!"~ [MO15345V]
@15346 = ~"Huh? Oh... sorry, chief. This kind of guy just gets to me..."~ [MO15346V]
@15347 = ~"Why, if I didn't know any better, I'd say-"~ [MO15347V]
@15348 = ~"What? I'm just a mimir, chief! I can't 'duel!'"~ [MO15348V]
@15349 = ~"It's, uh... sort of a talking encyclopedia. I don't like to talk about it; sort of embarrassing, really."~ [MO15349V]
@15350 = ~"Come on, chief... you going to let him get away with that? Let's go trounce that prissy rake! I'll go for his eyes while you lay into him!"~ [MO15350V]
@16613 = ~"Huh? Oh, yeah, chief, sure - whatever you say."~ [MO16613V]
@16614 = ~Morte looks at you for a while, silently, then nods. "Yeah, I can. If it's that important to you, I'll do it."~ [MO16614V]
@16615 = ~"You know, I *really* can't see this going anywhere. It's the old blood from a stone thing, chief - these little guys just don't work that way."~ [MO16615V]
@16616 = ~"Oh, boy; here we go. I can't *believe* you're wasting your time like this, boss!"~ [MO16616V]
@16617 = ~"You know, chief, I've seen some weird stuff... but it boggles my mind that that was even *possible.*"~ [MO16617V]
@16618 = ~"Oh! I can't watch!"~ [MO16618V]
@17533 = ~"Why not, boss? It'll be fun to kick around when we're down, right? Hmm... Well, I can kick it vicariously through you, at least. I wanna see that fifteen-foot hot coal jump, too!"~ [MO17533V]
@18801 = ~Morte turns to the Hiver. "Pike off."~ [MO18801V]
@18809 = ~Morte is holding one of the man's fingers between his teeth like some macabre cigar. He speaks around the finger: "Touch me again, and yer hand's gonna join yer finger, berk."~ [MO18809V]
@18813 = ~Morte spits the finger at the man. It bounces off the man's chest and falls to the ground.~ [MO18813V]
@18816 = ~Morte spins to face you: "Chief, don't give this trash anything."~ [MO18816V]
@18818 = ~Morte turns on the man. "I *wasn't* talking to you, arse-for-brains. When I talk to you, you'll know, 'cause I'll be grunting and snorting so you can understand what I'm saying."~ [MO18818V]
@18819 = ~"Chief, *don't.*"~ [MO18819V]
@18826 = ~"I'm floating with the biggest idiot in the multiverse."~ [MO18826V]
@18831 = ~"Chief! C'mon!"~ [MO18831V]
@18832 = ~"None too pretty from where I'm floating, either."~ [MO18832V]
@19031 = ~"Hey there, big hitter! How's your friend in the wall?"~ [MO19031V]
@19032 = ~Morte ducks his head. "Whatever you say, boss."~ [MO19032V]
@19551 = ~"Wow, chief... what a beauty, eh? Not everywhere you can meet a sweet little chit like that, ya know."~ [MO19551V]
@19552 = ~Morte's eyes roll in his skull. "Huh! One day, you'll see what I mean."~ [MO19552V]
@19553 = ~"Yeah, see, that's what I'm... hey!" Morte spins to face you. "Are you getting sarcastic on me?"~ [MO19553V]
@19681 = ~"Eh... don't know if you want to be talking to that... thing."~ [MO19681V]
@19682 = ~"They were once humans... they, or their ancestors, feasted on corpses, and this is what they've become. Pretty nasty stuff, chief... they're little more than animals, really. *Dangerous* animals."~ [MO19682V]
@19702 = ~"Eh... don't know if you want to be talking to that... thing."~ [MO19702V]
@19703 = ~"They were once humans... they, or their ancestors, feasted on corpses, and this is what they've become. Pretty nasty stuff, chief... they're little more than animals, really. *Dangerous* animals."~ [MO19703V]
@19704 = ~"It's not quite the same thing, chief..."~ [MO19704V]
@20469 = ~"This gravebait's blind and near-deaf."~ [MO20469V]
@20470 = ~"I think she means organs. I hope she means organs."~ [MO20470V]
@20471 = ~Morte turns to Marta. "Yes, 'thingies.'" He then turns to you. "It's all semantics."~ [MO20471V]
@20472 = ~"I am *not* going to watch this."~ [MO20472V]
@21602 = ~"Oh, for the powers' sake...! Piking dabus."~ [MO21602V]
@21603 = ~"He's a dabus. They 'speak' in rebuses, these annoying word puzzles. If *you* don't know what he's saying, then we better find a native or some other way to communicate with him... if we want to. An annoying bunch. My bet? They *can* speak, they just would rather piss everyone else off by trying to puzzle out what they're saying."~ [MO21603V]
@21604 = ~"Chant is they're janitors for the Lady of Pain. They float around breaking, fixing and patching up Sigil according to her whims. They're worse than corpse flies." Morte sighs. "You can't swat 'em though, or the Lady'll get... upset."~ [MO21604V]
@21605 = ~"She runs this city. You'll know if you see her: She's got these blades around her face, she's about the size of a giant, and she floats off the ground, just like these guys." Morte nods at the dabus, who is looking at you both. "Nobody knows much about her... she doesn't speak much. All you need to know is that you don't want to make her angry. If you see her, my advice: run."~ [MO21605V]
@21606 = ~Morte glances at the dabus, and his eyes widen. "Ah-ha! I knew you goat-heads could walk! I knew it!" Morte turns gleefully back to you. "Ha! This one must not be aloof enough to get off the ground."~ [MO21606V]
@21607 = ~Morte scoffs. "I'd sooner be strained through a tanar'ri's bowels than unravel what this goat-head's trying to say. You want a translator? Find a Sigil native."~ [MO21607V]
@21608 = ~Morte scoffs. "I'd sooner be strained through a tanar'ri's bowels than unravel what these floating goat-heads are trying to say. You want a translator? Get the fiendling chit to do it." He nods at Annah. "She's a Hive native."~ [MO21608V]
@21609 = ~Morte scoffs. "I'd sooner be strained through a tanar'ri's bowels than unravel what these floating goat-heads are trying to say. You want a translator?" He nods at Dak'kon. "Get holier-than-thou-and-twice-as-silent to translate."~ [MO21609V]
@21610 = ~Morte scoffs. "I'd sooner be strained through a tanar'ri's bowels than unravel what these floating goat-heads are trying to say. You want a translator? Get the tanar'ri to do it." He nods at Fall-from-Grace. "She's probably had to trade the chant with these guys all the time."~ [MO21610V]
@22061 = ~"You just want to kill them. Sentience threatens the Dustmen."~ [MO22061V]
@22849 = ~Morte stares at you and shakes his head.~ [MO22849V]
@22852 = ~"Hey! It didn't say that!"~ [MO22852V]
@22855 = ~"Wh-?! Gimme that thing!"~ [MO22855V]
@22858 = ~"I. Just. Want. To. Hold. It. For. A. Second."~ [MO22858V]
@22861 = ~"I'll hold it in my TEETH."~ [MO22861V]
@24174 = ~"You know, boss, I was getting really sick of his... constant... pauses... anyway... it's a ... good thing... he's shut up... now."~ [MO24174V]
@24176 = ~"Boss, what do we need with an endless supply of water? Where's the fire, huh?"~ [MO24176V]
@24179 = ~"The right thing to do? In case you've forgotten, boss, you've got a quest of your own to take care of! But hey, whatever you want to do, you're in charge here. Sheesh..."~ [MO24179V]
@24903 = ~"Hey... are you all right? I thought you were a deader for sure."~ [MO24903V]
@24906 = ~"Uh... who am I? How about *you* start? Who're you?"~ [MO24906V]
@24909 = ~"You can't remember your *name?* Heh. Well, next time you spend a night on the town, go easy on the bub. Name's Morte. I'm trapped in here, too."~ [MO24909V]
@24911 = ~"Yeah, 'an I asked you *second.* What's your name?"~ [MO24911V]
@24914 = ~"Tchhhh... you're tighter than a wet rope. All right, *I'll* be the nice guy here. Name's Morte. Who're you?"~ [MO24914V]
@24916 = ~"Yeah, since you haven't had time to get your legs yet, here's the chant: I've tried all the doors, and this room is locked tighter than a chastity belt."~ [MO24916V]
@24918 = ~"It's called the 'Mortuary'... it's a big black structure with all the architectural charm of a pregnant spider."~ [MO24918V]
@24920 = ~"Not from where I'm standing. You got scars a-plenty, though... looks like some berk painted you with a knife. All the more reason to give this place the laugh before whoever carved you up comes back to finish the job."~ [MO24920V]
@24922 = ~"Well, all the doors are locked, so we'll need the key. Chances are, one of the walking corpses in this room have it."~ [MO24922V]
@24924 = ~"Yeah, the Mortuary keepers use dead bodies as cheap labor. The corpses are dumb as stones, but they're harmless, and won't attack you unless you attack first."~ [MO24924V]
@24927 = ~"What, you think it's going to hurt their feelings? They're DEAD. But if you want a bright side to this: if you kill them, at least they'll have a rest before their keepers raise them up to work again."~ [MO24927V]
@24929 = ~"Well, before you do that, arm yourself first. I think there's a scalpel on one of the shelves around here."  ^NNOTE: Search the shelves in this room for a weapon to attack the zombies with.^-~ [MO24929V]
@24931 = ~"One last thing: Those corpses are as slow as molasses, but getting punched by one of them is like being kissed by a battering ram. If they start getting an edge on you, remember you can RUN, and they can't. Use it to keep some distance if you need to recover."  ^NNOTE: <RUNAWAY> If you are in danger of dying, use running to keep your distance from the zombies while you recover.^-~ [MO24931V]
@25962 = ~"Sort of a talking encyclopedia, chief. I don't like to talk about it, really."~ [MO25962V]
@25964 = ~Morte waggles his eyebrows and begins to float towards the woman. "That's not all I-"~ [MO25964V]
@25966 = ~"Yeah, yeah. Fine." Morte rolls his eyes and starts to mumble. "Sheesh, I might as well be *dead*..."~ [MO25966V]
@25970 = ~Morte interrupts her: "Well, you see, chief, it's all about differences in the *quality* of your mimir. Some - like me - are more enchanted than others, that's all. More... uh... 'self-aware,' is the term."~ [MO25970V]
@25973 = ~"Hey! I'm just trying to have some fun here, chief!"~ [MO25973V]
@27285 = ~"Some advice, chief: I'd keep it quiet from here on - no need to put any more corpses in the dead-book than necessary... especially the femmes. Plus, killing them might draw the caretakers here."~ [MO27285V]
@27286 = ~"They call themselves the 'Dustmen.' You can't miss 'em: They have an obsession with black and rigor mortis of the face. They're an addled bunch of ghoulish death-worshippers; they believe everybody should die... sooner better than later."~ [MO27286V]
@27287 = ~"Weren't you listening?! I said the Dusties believe EVERYBODY'S got to die, sooner better than later. You think the corpses you've seen are happier in the dead-book than out of it?"~ [MO27287V]
@27288 = ~"Death visits the planes every day, chief. These lummoxes are all that's left of the poor sods who sold their bodies to the caretakers after death."~ [MO27288V]
@27289 = ~"Wh- are you *serious?* Look, chief, these dead chits are the last chance for a couple of hardy bashers like us. We need to be *chivalrous*... no hacking them up for keys, no lopping their limbs off, things like that."~ [MO27289V]
@27290 = ~"Chief, THEY'RE dead, WE'RE dead... see where I'm going? Eh? Eh?"~ [MO27290V]
@27291 = ~"Chief, we already got an opening line with these limping ladies. We've *all* died at least once: we'll have something to talk about. They'll appreciate men with our kind of death experience."~ [MO27291V]
@27292 = ~"Well... all right, *you* might not be dead, but *I* am. And from where I'm standing, I wouldn't mind sharing a coffin with some of these fine, sinewy cadavers I see here." Morte starts clacking his teeth, as if in anticipation. "'Course, the caretakers would have to part with them first, and that's not likely..."~ [MO27292V]
@27293 = ~"Look, chief. You're still a little addled after your kiss with death. So two bits of advice for you: one, if you got questions, *ask* me, all right?"  ^NNOTE: <SPEAKTO>^-~ [MO27293V]
@27294 = ~"Second, if you're *half* as forgetful as you seem to be, start writing stuff down - whenever you come across something that might be important, jot it down so you don't forget."~ [MO27294V]
@27295 = ~"Yeah, like a journal. If you ever start to get cloudy on important things, like where you are, flip to it and refresh your memory. Got it?"  ^NNOTE: To access your journal, select the journal button on the quick menu. Your journal will automatically be updated throughout the game.^-~ [MO27295V]
@27296 = ~"There should be a scalpel on one of the shelves around here. I'd find it before locking horns with any of the corpses around here."~ [MO27296V]
@27297 = ~"All right, you found the scalpel! Now, go get those corpses... and don't worry, I'll stay back and provide valuable tactical advice."~ [MO27297V]
@27298 = ~"I WILL be helping you. Good advice is hard to come by."~ [MO27298V]
@27299 = ~"Me? I'm a romantic, not a soldier. I'd just get in the way."~ [MO27299V]
@27300 = ~"Eh... all right. I'll help you."  ^NNOTE: If you wish Morte to help you attack, simply make sure the both of you are selected when you attack the corpse. Morte will join in the attack.^-~ [MO27300V]
@27301 = ~"All right, you took care of the right corpse, it looks like. Now you gotta find the key. It should have been on its body. Once we have it, we can get out of here."~ [MO27301V]
@27302 = ~"All right, that's the key. It must fit the lock of one of the doors in the room."~ [MO27302V]
@27911 = ~Morte hisses into your ear: "Lawyer."~ [MO27911V]
@27912 = ~"Sort of a talking encyclopedia, chief. I don't like to talk about it, really."~ [MO27912V]
@27913 = ~Morte waggles his eyebrows and begins to float towards the woman. "That's not all I-"~ [MO27913V]
@27915 = ~"Yeah, yeah. Fine." Morte rolls his eyes and starts to mumble. "Sheesh, I might as well be *dead*..."~ [MO27915V]
@27919 = ~Morte interrupts her: "Well, you see, chief, it's all about differences in the *quality* of your mimir. Some - like me - are more enchanted than others, that's all. More... uh... 'self-aware,' is the term."~ [MO27919V]
@27922 = ~"Hey! I'm just trying to have some fun here, chief!"~ [MO27922V]

@28630 = ~"Sounds dull."~ [MO28630V]
@28631 = ~"She's a tanar'ri... a succubus, chief."~ [MO28631V]
@28632 = ~"Bar that, fiendling!" Morte clicks his teeth together. "I'm ALL for the succubus coming with us... the powers know *you're* about as fun as passing a caltrop through your bowels."~ [MO28632V]
@28633 = ~"Hey, wait just a minute! *I'm* the one well-versed in the planes! That's my job, chief!"~ [MO28633V]
@28635 = ~"Pleasant on the eyes, maybe! Looks to ME like all some chit has to do is show a little skin, and you'll sign her right up!" Morte falls silent. "Not that I mind that really, I just thought I'd mention it."~ [MO28635V]
@28637 = ~"What my scarred companion meant to say is, the TWO of us... I'm Morte, by the way: my apologies for my companion's rudeness in not introducing us... think it would be an EXCELLENT idea if you came on board. We have plenty of room for a succubus. PLENTY of room."~ [MO28637V]
@28738 = ~"Thanks, chief. I can't tell you how glad I am to be back with you." His voice drips with sarcasm. "And here I learned a new trick while I was there and everything."~ [MO28738V]
@28739 = ~"Really? That's kind of you, boss. Good thinking. You're provisionally forgiven. Just don't do it again."~ [MO28739V]
@28740 = ~"Somehow, I don't believe you for a second. Let's just forget this ever happened. Let's go."~ [MO28740V]
@28741 = ~"Thanks, boss. Let's get out of here!" Morte pauses. "Oh, by the way, boss... those guys really had their heads together. They taught me something sharp."~ [MO28741V]
@28962 = ~"Uh... chief? You've seen statues before, right? Know that they don't talk or anything?"~ [MO28962V]
@28963 = ~"Well... uh... hmm. Got me there, boss."~ [MO28963V]
@28964 = ~"Maybe it's a little too anatomically correct, chief?"~ [MO28964V]
@28965 = ~"Sure, boss. I knew that."~ [MO28965V]
@28966 = ~Morte rolls his eyes and makes a gagging noise. "Powers, no, not another berk that talks... like... this!"~ [MO28966V]
@29677 = ~"Hey, chief - he's got his fingers crossed!"~ [MO29677V]
@30527 = ~Morte breaks in with a whisper. "He's saying he's a lawyer. A counselor. One of those berks who rattle their bone-boxes at the courts."~ [MO30527V]
@30816 = ~Morte turns and looks behind him. "Where?! Where?!"~ [MO30816V]
@30817 = ~Morte gasps. "Look, behind you - another floating skull!"~ [MO30817V]
@30818 = ~"Right where I'm pointing! There!"~ [MO30818V]

@52571 = ~"It swallowed him, but I don't know if he came out of *that* end."~ [MO52571V]
@52573 = ~"I think I know who should be in a cage..."~ [MO52573V]
@52574 = ~"Well, I didn't have anything BETTER to do except go to one of the Lady's mazes and meet one of the evilest creatures ever to set foot in Sigil, so I said 'sure! Why n-?'"~ [MO52574V]
@52576 = ~"'Be quiet?!'" Morte clacks his teeth. "Like the hells I will! I think we've listened to this crone rattle her bone-box enough, and now she's got some pair of stones, saying I haven't got any skin! So WHAT if I don't?! Obviously the fact SHE has skin has done wonders for HER looks! Does she think I *like* being NAKED all the time? And *another* thing-"~ [MO52576V]
@52644 = ~"Freaky. So where are we technically standing right now?"~ [MO52644V]
@53623 = ~"Oh, that's just *great.*"~ [MO53623V]
@53624 = ~As you make to step closer to the Pillar, Morte hisses to you: "Pssst! Chief! Chief... listen, I can't let that thing see me. You've got to get me out of here... drop me off somewhere, pick me up later or something..."~ [MO53624V]
@53626 = ~"Eh... I don't really like to talk about it. Let's just get moving, yeah?" Morte's voice trembles with fear; his eyes flicker back and forth between you and the massive pillar of heads.~ [MO53626V]
@53632 = ~Morte sighs, unable to meet your stare. At last, he relents. "Fine, fine... I'll tell you. There's this pillar on Avernus, the first layer of Baator, built of the heads of all those who've led others to their deaths through lies. Well... that's it right there. See, that's where I ended up. Go figure."~ [MO53632V]
@53664 = ~"Yeah. I told an... exaggeration or two. It's just that one of my suggestions led to your death. One of them. Maybe others. I don't really know - those memories are gone, now."~ [MO53664V]
@53666 = ~"Yeah. I told an... exaggeration or two. It's just that one of my suggestions-"~ [MO53666V]
@53667 = ~Morte continues, unperturbed. "...one of my *suggestions* led to your death. One of them. Maybe others. I don't really know - those memories are gone, now."~ [MO53667V]
@53668 = ~Morte stares at your feet - you've never seen him look so miserable. "Those memories, they... look, chief, I don't even remember *being* human. I don't remember what life was like before the Pillar..."~ [MO53668V]
@53794 = ~Morte glances at Dak'kon, then you. "Yeah, I guess. And that's pretty much the way of things when you die. You... forget. I figure I wasn't a sterling member of the community when I was alive... but hells, who is?" Morte sighs again. "It's just that I can't help it. Nothing's worse than being honest all the time. But look, chief: if that pile of heads sees me, it'll want me back - *bad.* You can't let that happen!"~ [MO53794V]
@53800 = ~"Anyway, I figure I wasn't a sterling member of the community when I was alive... but hells, who is?" Morte sighs again. "It's just that I can't help it. Nothing's worse than being honest all the time. But look, chief: if that pile of heads *sees* me, it'll want me back - *bad.* You can't let that happen!"~ [MO53800V]
@53806 = ~"Well... you pulled me off, chief. I fought my way to the front of the Pillar - you've been here before, you know - yammering and howling until you had noticed me. I begged to be freed, swearing that I'd follow you, sharing my knowledge until your final days... I just didn't realize how long that'd be until after you'd already torn me free."~ [MO53806V]
@53808 = ~"Oh, that... well, I also didn't realize I'd lose most of the Pillar's accumulated knowledge once I was out of it. Piking powers, did *that* ever set you off! But you kept me around just the same. And at first I felt 'bound' to you... that maybe your sorcery had turned me into some sort of familiar. But after a couple hundred years, I realized it was *more* than that... something deeper. More than just a debt of gratitude, too, though that sure as the hells had something to do with it. I just felt drawn, *connected* to you, somehow. Maybe it's all your suffering, chief... your torment. I don't know. Maybe I likened it to my own, when I was in that pillar."~ [MO53808V]
@53813 = ~Morte suddenly becomes defensive. "Because I never *know* who you're going to be! Some of your incarnations have been stark, raving mad! One time you awoke obsessed with the idea that *I* was your skull, and chased me around the Spire trying to shatter and devour me... luckily, you were crushed by a passing cart in the street. Another, 'good and lawful,' you tried to thrust me back into the Pillar, because 'it's where I belonged.'" Morte smirks. "*That's* why. Besides, no harm's ever come of you not knowing..."~ [MO53813V]
@53818 = ~"Don't know. Ages, I suppose. I've done all I could to help you find your way each time, but..." Morte sighs, then lifts himself up to meet your gaze. "You rarely make it this far, chief. I mean it; only four or five times, I think. This could be the time... the 'you' that makes it, finds out what's going on."~ [MO53818V]
@53823 = ~"Oh, no..."~ [MO53823V]
@53824 = ~Morte shakes with fear, his teeth rattling. "I can't go back, chief! I can't! I can't! I can't!"~ [MO53824V]
@53829 = ~"Come *on,* chief; didn't I just *tell* you what it was?! It's composed of the heads of liars whose 'advice' sent those they advised to their deaths. It can answer almost any question - it knows more than a lot - but it'll expect a whole mess of payment for its services. Don't ask it a question like that!"~ [MO53829V]
@53830 = ~"Don't put me back in there, chief. Please!"~ [MO53830V]
@53831 = ~"Chief?! No! No! You *can't!* Come on!"~ [MO53831V]
@53842 = ~Morte looks at you skeptically. "You *sure?* You *swear* it? Hey, what am I saying?! No! No way! C'mon, you *can't* put me back in there!"~ [MO53842V]
@53849 = ~Morte stares at you in silence for a while, his mouth agape. "WHAT?! Not a chance! You're just not as powerful as you were when... look, forget it, you couldn't do it, it's not going to happen! C'mon, you *can't* put me back in there!"~ [MO53849V]
@53857 = ~"Whoa there... wait! Not so fast! Pillar... I could tell you where Fhjull Forked-Tongue is! Come on, don't you want to know? So what if he gives you that, instead of me? Eh? What d'ya say?"~ [MO53857V]
@53860 = ~"What? Are you *barmy?!* You'll sell *me* out, but not that *FIEND?!* The only reason he helped you is because he's bound, cursed! What about *me?* Who got you out of the Mortuary, pal? Who's gonna stand - er, float - beside you when you face down whatever's waiting for you at that Fortress of Whatever?! Huh?! Huh?! NOT FHJULL FAT-ARSE, THAT'S FOR DAMNED SURE!"~ [MO53860V]
@54155 = ~"Why not, chief?" Morte shakes his head. "I mean, we've gone to every OTHER horrible plane in the multiverse I can think of. Why not take that extra step over the cliff?" He gives a rattling sigh. "Are YOU ready? Because if you're not..."~ [MO54155V]
@54159 = ~"Well, I..." Morte glances at the shimmering blue curtain and gives another rattling sigh. "Sure. Let's go. I mean, any place else has got to be better than rattling our bone-box in the Mortuary, right?"~ [MO54159V]
@54161 = ~"Eh..." Morte hesitates, glances at the portal, glances at you, glances at the portal again, then gives a rattling sigh. "Look, I'm not going to say *too* much here, but uh... well, there's something I need to tell you..."~ [MO54161V]
@54164 = ~"Well, it's about where we're going... or eh, actually where... we've... *been.*"~ [MO54164V]
@54168 = ~"Uh... chief?" Morte hesitates, glances at the portal, glances at you, glances at the portal again, then gives a rattling sigh. "Look, I'm not going to say *too* much here, but uh... well, there's something I need to tell you..."~ [MO54168V]
@54171 = ~"Well, it's about where you're going... or eh, actually where you... we've... *been.*"~ [MO54171V]
@54175 = ~"This... uh, this isn't the FIRST time we've been through this... you see, we've been to this 'Fortress of Regrets' before... though, we... I... didn't know it then."~ [MO54175V]
@54181 = ~"It's hard to explain until you've *been* there... besides, you didn't know the, uh, *other* you - he wasn't exactly the kind of basher to SHARE the chant with us. I mean, I knew he was looking for SOME place, but I didn't know why, where it was, or WHAT it was, so I couldn't say ANYTHING to you, because I didn't know ANYTHING! I... just know what happened when we GOT there..."~ [MO54181V]
@54193 = ~Morte looks alarmed. "No! No! We... I... never KNEW any of that! It's not like you were always the most sharing basher in the planes! That... that *other* you kept a LOT of the chant to himself, and we didn't even know WHY we were going to this place before or even WHAT this place was! I just know what happened when we GOT there..."~ [MO54193V]
@54198 = ~"Well, we went to this - this FORTRESS, and before we even land foot in this place, we're all SPLIT up, fighting for our lives... so the *first* thing I want to tell you is if you're determined to go through with this, there's a good chance anybody who goes through that portal is going to end up somewhere *far* away from everybody else. Thing is, you'll still need people there with you..."~ [MO54198V]
@54202 = ~"Well, we went to this - this FORTRESS, and even before we land foot in this place, we're all SPLIT up, fighting for our lives..." He shudders. "So the *first* thing I want to tell you is if you're determined to go through with this, there's a good chance that anybody who goes through that portal is going to end up somewhere *far* away from everybody else. Thing is, even split up, we may be your only hope..."~ [MO54202V]
@54206 = ~"Because whatever was waiting in that Fortress for you, chief, it already defeated you once... to this day, I don't know how you managed to survive, but if you fall again, you're going to need someone there to pull you out of that Fortress..."~ [MO54206V]
@54211 = ~"This 'Fortress of Regrets'... it stretches on for LEAGUES, chief. It's a Fortress, but it feels more like a PLANE in itself, all stone, all darkness, and shadows - everywhere, shadows. You go there, and... you better be prepared."~ [MO54211V]
@54215 = ~"This 'Fortress of Regrets'... it stretches on for LEAGUES, chief. It's a Fortress, but it feels more like a PLANE in itself, all stone, all darkness, and shadows - everywhere, shadows. We go there, and... we better be prepared."~ [MO54215V]
@54219 = ~"Chief, I don't know what happened to YOU, but I know what happened to ME... I spent my time running from vault to vault, those shadows crawling all over me, trying to bring me down... then, I just... suddenly, we were 'out,' like someone had pulled us back..."~ [MO54219V]
@54229 = ~Morte falls silent for a moment. "No... there were others. There was... Dak'kon, this Sensate chit, Deionarra, this blind archer who was half-sodden with drink all the time, and you and me... and things just went to the hells and back. Obviously, you, me, and Dak'kon made it, but those other two didn't; I don't know what happened to them."~ [MO54229V]
@54234 = ~Morte falls silent for a moment. "No... there were others. There was... this old gith, Dak'kon, this Sensate chit, Deionarra, this blind archer who was half-sodden with drink all the time, and you and me... and things just went to the hells and back. Obviously, you, me, and Dak'kon made it, but those other two didn't; I don't know what happened to them."~ [MO54234V]
@54239 = ~Morte shakes his head. "Not that I know of."~ [MO54239V]
@54243 = ~"I can't tell you anymore, chief - except we're bound to be divided as soon as we arrive, it's a HUGE place, and it's crawling with shadows... and somewhere in that Fortress is something more powerful than *any* of us. There's nothing more to say..."~ [MO54243V]
@54249 = ~"Well..." Morte pauses. "Yeah, there's one other thing you should know - the YOU I knew before, the YOU that led us here, he wasn't like you. At all."~ [MO54249V]
@54263 = ~"The other YOU, he... he didn't care very much for anybody. For anyone. We could have ALL died in the Fortress, and he wouldn't have blinked. So... I just want you to hold on to your differences, because... well, I like this *you* better. A LOT better."~ [MO54263V]
@54268 = ~"All's I'm saying is that, despite all your asinine behavior, YOU got more spirit than he ever did. The other YOU, he... he was detached from everything. So... I just want you to keep that in mind."~ [MO54268V]
@54273 = ~"No..." Morte pauses. "There's one other thing - I may not have liked that *other* you very much, but he was one smart basher - the smartest basher I've ever known; he always had every angle covered. If he died at the Fortress, that means... well..."~ [MO54273V]
@54277 = ~"No..." Morte shakes his head. "It's not that, chief. Because it's not always who's smartest, or who's the most powerful, or who's the toughest... sometimes it comes down to who you are and what you *really* want. I mean, once you wanted to become immortal - but in the end, is that *really* what you wanted? Just be sure of what you want this time, is all I'm saying."~ [MO54277V]
@54281 = ~"Yeah... I know, chief. And I can't lie to you... I don't want to go... but I will. Just know that once we step through that portal, it isn't going to be just about *you* anymore. This is our lives you're playing with, and we don't get back up when we die."~ [MO54281V]
@54762 = ~Morte shoots back, "You don't smell any better. When was the last time you bathed?"~ [MO54762V]
@54763 = ~Morte shoots back, "You don't smell any better. When was the last time you bathed?"~ [MO54763V]
@54764 = ~Morte shoots back, "You don't smell any better. When was the last time you bathed?"~ [MO54764V]
@54831 = ~"What Ravel said, in the maze - she said you draw people who suffer to you, like a lodestone." Morte shakes his head. "Maybe it's because *you've* been suffering all this time. Maybe when you end up settling things... maybe *we'll* know a bit of peace, too. Maybe."~ [MO54831V]
@54834 = ~"What Ravel said, in the maze - and what Fell said about that symbol, Torment? They say you draw people who suffer to you, like a lodestone." Morte shakes his head. "Maybe it's because *you've* been suffering all this time. Maybe when you end up settling things... maybe *we'll* know a bit of peace, too. Maybe."~ [MO54834V]
@54837 = ~"I've known you for a long time, chief, and there's *something* about you - you draw people who suffer to you, like a lodestone." Morte shakes his head. "Maybe it's because *you've* been suffering all this time. Maybe when you end up settling things... maybe *we'll* know a bit of peace, too. Maybe."~ [MO54837V]
@54840 = ~Morte falls silent.~ [MO54840V]
@54841 = ~"The skull was me." Morte says quietly. "The woman was some chit named Deionarra; I never knew the archer..."~ [MO54841V]
@54842 = ~"Yeah..." Morte rattles, as if shivering. "Chief, at this Fortress - there's shadows *everywhere*..."~ [MO54842V]
@54843 = ~"They spoke to me like the Pillar of Skulls..." Morte's voice drops. "They *knew*..."~ [MO54843V]
@54845 = ~"I can't tell you anymore, chief - except we're bound to be divided as soon as we arrive, it's a HUGE place, and it's crawling with shadows... and somewhere in that Fortress is something more powerful than *any* of us."~ [MO54845V]
@54846 = ~"I can't tell you anymore, chief - except any group that goes in there is bound to be divided as soon as they arrive, it's a HUGE place, and it's crawling with shadows... and somewhere in that Fortress is something more powerful than anything you've encountered."~ [MO54846V]
@55832 = ~"Chief, we're looking at trouble here - this modron's gone rogue."~ [MO55832V]
@55834 = ~"Yeah, you see, sometimes modrons get a little chaos in 'em, and when that happens... well, I guess the *best* explanation is that rogue modrons are kind of like... backwards modrons."~ [MO55834V]
@55837 = ~"Chief, as much fun as this is, prying a bar stool out of a baatezu's rear might prove more worthwhile than rattling our bone-boxes with this stupid polygon."~ [MO55837V]
@55841 = ~"Chief, I have no idea what this cube is rattling on about."~ [MO55841V]
@55845 = ~"Wh- I know more than *you,* you staggering, guttural amnesiac! 'Sides, here's three more bits of knowledge to rattle around in that empty brain-box of yours: one, there are NO experts on the planes, two, I'm the closest thing to one you're going to find, and three, treat me with some respect. Why? See the second reason."~ [MO55845V]
@55848 = ~"Mechanus? Boring in every sense of the word, chief. Imagine a plane filled with modrons and big turning gears, and you have the great big BORING plane of Mechanus. Too many laws, too annoying. A place you wouldn't even want to think about, let alone visit."~ [MO55848V]
@55855 = ~"Excuse ME, Miss Priestess of Piety, but Mechanus IS the most boring place in the universe... the only interesting thing about it would be if *you* visited..." Morte rolls his eyes. "But I have a feeling even *that* would lose its charm after a while."~ [MO55855V]
@55860 = ~"All modrons are part of this 'pool,' chief, kind of like a big bank of energy... when one of them dies, the energy it took to make the modron is absorbed back into the bank, and a new one's spit out. Thing is... when a modron goes a little nutty, he kind of cuts that connection, but he keeps a bit of the energy."~ [MO55860V]
@55867 = ~Morte glares at Fall-from-Grace. "Do you *mind?* I had the answer covered, thank you. *I'm* the font of information here, NOT you, all right?"~ [MO55867V]
@55870 = ~"Oh, *I* get it! Maybe if I was a succubus, you'd listen to ME more often, that it? Maybe if I showed a little skin once in a while, then I'd get some respect, huh? That's pretty shallow, chief, pretty shallow! Why, I ought to -"~ [MO55870V]
@55871 = ~NULL NODE~ [MO55871V]
@55873 = ~"Oh, yeah?! I...?! Well...! Yeah, you just... yeah, you hear that, chief? What the succubus said? She's right. I'm easier to understand, more 'wise to the chant,' know what I'm saying? So you need me around, see?"~ [MO55873V]
@55882 = ~Morte nods.~ [MO55882V]
@55886 = ~"Eh... no."~ [MO55886V]
@55890 = ~"Well, they'll take his energy, chief, and they'll spit out another modron, but it won't be Nordom, because he's not *really* a modron anymore; he's got too much of the planes in him. They'll make a non-Nordom replacement."~ [MO55890V]
@55897 = ~Morte pauses for a moment. "Well... yeah, you could put it like that. I mean, if he hadn't had his little rogue rebellion, then he'd be fine... if he died, another modron would pop up just like him. But since he became 'backwards' - well, that part's going to be lost when he dies."~ [MO55897V]
@55901 = ~"Aighhhh! For the sake of the powers and my sanity, cut it out! He's going to snap a crank if you keep asking him that over and over!"~ [MO55901V]
@55909 = ~"Oh." Morte 'grins.' "You could have SAID something. By all means, continue. Of course..." Morte *clicks* his teeth, imitating Nordom. "If you want to know about modrons, you should ask ME."~ [MO55909V]
@55914 = ~"Look, chief, NORMAL modrons barely understand anything beyond their basic tasks, and this stupid polygon here is fresh off the planes to boot. Don't confuse the cube, all right? At least, not while he's armed. You want to know about modrons, ask me, not him."~ [MO55914V]
@55921 = ~"It's like this, chief: Modrons are these stupid geometric shapes that clank around on their home plane, Mechanus - they're really tidy, orderly, and they'd like the REST of the multiverse to be, too. That's why they're such pests."~ [MO55921V]
@55930 = ~"It's the plane where all these clockwork drones come from. Ask him about it, see what he says. It's where they sit around and tidy up everything all the time... catalogue this, put *this* in order, put *that* in order, make that law, and so on and so forth."~ [MO55930V]
@55938 = ~Morte glances at Nordom, who is holding up his left crossbow to the side of his head, as if listening to it.~ [MO55938V]
@55940 = ~"Because, chief, chaos has its place. And if everything was the way a *modron* sees things, it wouldn't be much of a life... at least a life I'd want to live. They just want to make everything *structured.* Yechhhh."~ [MO55940V]
@56029 = ~"I *like* the way she smells. It's pretty."~ [MO56029V]
@56030 = ~"Hold on, chief... Baator is BAD news. This fiend is probably holding out on us... and even if there is a 'Pillar of Skulls,' we can probably find somebody else who knows how to reach this Fortress *without* going to one of the most dangerous planes in the multiverse."~ [MO56030V]
@56033 = ~"It's a dangerous place, chief. I'd rather not go. I've been, and it isn't pretty. All right?"~ [MO56033V]
@56936 = ~"This guy shows up *everywhere!*"~ [MO56936V]
@59827 = ~(NULL NODE)~ [MO59827V]
@60950 = ~"Hey, being dead's not so bad. Look on the bright side... at least you don't have to talk with those ridiculous squiggles anymore."~ [MO60950V]
@61408 = ~"Eh... say there, chief... what do you say? How about spotting old Morte a bit of jink? It's been more than a while, you know..."~ [MO61408V]
@61409 = ~"All right! Thanks, chief!" Morte turns to follow the woman away.~ [MO61409V]
@61410 = ~Morte seems only dimly aware of your presence, and alternates between giggling to himself and sighing pleasantly.~ [MO61410V]
@62890 = ~"She's a tanar'ri... a succubus, chief."~ [MO62890V]
@64990 = ~"Hold up, chief... look at this." Peering down, you notice a number of dirty footprints that lead into the archway... and do not turn around. "There must be a portal through here or something."~ [MO64990V]
@64992 = ~"Haven't the slightest, chief. It's got to be a common key, though - look at all the traffic that's gone through! Maybe one of the low-lives around here will know..."~ [MO64992V]
@65552 = ~"Aw, *c'mon,* chief. Don't tell me you forgot again."~ [MO65552V]
@65557 = ~"Bet I'm going to be hearing THAT a lot." Morte clears his throat. "Let's see..."  'I know you feel like you've been drinking a few kegs of Styx wash, but you need to CENTER yourself. Among your possessions is a JOURNAL that'll shed some light on the dark of the matter. PHAROD can fill you in on the rest of the chant, if he's not in the dead-book already.'~ [MO65557V]
@65562 = ~"I will, I will, hold on." Morte pauses for a moment. "All right, here's the last bit..."  'Don't lose the journal or we'll be up the Styx again. And whatever you do, DO NOT tell anyone WHO you are or WHAT happens to you, or they'll put you on a quick pilgrimage to the crematorium. Do what I tell you: READ the journal, then FIND Pharod.'~ [MO65562V]
@65563 = ~"What are you talking about, chief? There isn't any more."~ [MO65563V]
@65564 = ~"And of course, that little bit at the end about not trusting skulls."~ [MO65564V]
@65577 = ~"Oh... *that* bit at the end? Well, I figured it was wash, so I didn't read that line out loud."~ [MO65577V]
@65581 = ~"I doubt it. I mean, you can trust *me,* right, chief?"~ [MO65581V]
@65585 = ~"No! C'mon, what's your problem, chief? I haven't steered you wrong yet."~ [MO65585V]
@65589 = ~"Nothing! I've told you everything... well, ALMOST everything, but nothing, you know, *dangerous.*"~ [MO65589V]
@65593 = ~"Chief, seriously, there's nothing else. I wouldn't hold out on you."~ [MO65593V]
@65596 = ~"Sigil's a ring-shaped city that's squatting on top of an infinitely tall spire in what some claim to be in the center of the planes... of course, *how* it could be at the top of an infinitely tall spire, and how the city could even *be* at the center of the planes raises some questions."~ [MO65596V]
@65600 = ~"Sigil's called the 'City of Doors,' mostly because there's a LOT of invisible doors that lead in and out of it - just about any arch, door frame, barrel hoop, book shelf, or open window might be a portal under the right conditions.

@65604 = ~"See, I guess the best way to explain it is - most portals are 'sleeping,' right? You could walk through them, by them, on top of them, and nothing would happen. Now, every portal has something that 'wakes it up.' That could be a tune you hum to yourself, a loaf of week-old Bytopian bread, remembering what your first kiss was like, and then - BAM - the portal gets its juices flowing, and you can jump through it, to whatever's on the other side."~ [MO65604V]
@65608 = ~"Anywhere, chief. Literally. Any place you can think of, there's a portal there. That's why Sigil's so popular across the planes."~ [MO65608V]
@65611 = ~"Hey! Chattering's my best trait." He rattles his teeth for a moment, then 'grins.' "Eh? Eh?"~ [MO65611V]
@65616 = ~"No, but seriously, chief - I got a knack for chattering in just the right way. I can really bend an ear, if you know what I'm saying. I got insults, backtalk - stuff that'll curl someone's ears into their skull, y'know?"~ [MO65616V]
@65620 = ~"It's one of my many talents... I call it my 'Litany of Curses.' You see, sometimes I can really bend someone's ear with *just* the right comment. Of course, then I usually have to do a lot of running afterwards... but you get the idea."~ [MO65620V]
@65626 = ~"Well, I can spit insults at someone until they get mad enough to chase me around."  ^NNOTE: Morte has an ability called 'Litany of Curses.' It is a non-magical taunt; if the target fails to resist it, they suffer a penalty to their Armor Class, attacks, and will do nothing but try to engage Morte in melee combat. Note that the more insults Morte hears, the better his Litany of Curses becomes. The Litany of Curses is VERY effective against mages.^-~ [MO65626V]
@65630 = ~"Well, I made some friends when I was sitting on the shelf in Lothar's waiting for you to bail me out - thanks for taking your sweet time about it, by the way - they said if I needed any help, I could just call on them."~ [MO65630V]
@65634 = ~"Well, I just whistle, and they kind of show up. They're a good bunch of bashers - bite like *snakes,* too."  ^NNOTE: Morte (now) has a special ability called "Skull Mob." When invoked, he can summon a horde of skulls from off-screen to come and bite an opponent multiple times. The strength and damage of the skulls varies according to Morte's level, and the power can only be used a limited number of times per day.^-~ [MO65634V]
@65638 = ~"Well, here's how *I* see things..."~ [MO65638V]
@65650 = ~"The way I see it, it's your show here, chief. There's not much I can say now that could help."~ [MO65650V]
@65653 = ~"I think you should try and root out this 'Pharod' wherever he's set up kip. You wouldn't have had those directions tattooed on your back if he didn't have some inkling of what was up with you. One of the locals around here HAS to know where he is."~ [MO65653V]
@65656 = ~"I say we try and nick this 'bronze sphere' as soon as possible and get it back to ol' stutter-crutch."~ [MO65656V]
@65659 = ~"I say we go find out where your corpse ended up. Maybe we can find out how you got penned in the dead-book."~ [MO65659V]
@65662 = ~"I say we go find someone who knows some more about you - and how you got this way. There has to be some canny bashers in one of the Wards who knows something more about you."~ [MO65662V]
@65665 = ~"Looks like we need to find out more about that night hag, Ravel - and I have to tell you, chief, I'm *not* looking forward to that. The Festhall sages and some of the sensory stones might be able to tell us something, though."~ [MO65665V]
@65670 = ~"Sorry, chief - I keep forgetting you have all the knowing of a green prime. Look, the Festhall is the main kip of the Sensate faction in the Clerk's Ward. They have libraries of sensory stones that store experiences, and they have plenty of sages, lecturers, and trainers that might be able to tumble us onto the dark of what's up with Ravel."~ [MO65670V]
@65673 = ~"Well, Ravel got mazed. Still, there's probably SOME key and SOME portal that could take us there, if you still want to go."~ [MO65673V]
@65679 = ~"No idea - I mean, a 'piece of Ravel'? That could be anything from one of her dried out warts, to a work of art she did, or some dribblings from her lip. It's too vague. Still, I'm betting SOMEONE in the Clerk's Ward has to know something about how to snag a piece of that barmy witch. Failing that, we could check the sensory stones in the Festhall - maybe one of those stones could tell us something of use."~ [MO65679V]
@65683 = ~"Beats me, chief. There's tons of portals in Sigil. I say try the Festhall - I doubt it's there, but one of the sensory stones might be able to tell us something. Failing that, I say we forget all this running around and get someone to MAKE us a portal."~ [MO65683V]
@65686 = ~"I say we find what we need, and get the hells outta here, chief. This place is giving me the shivers, and I don't even have skin. All right?"~ [MO65686V]
@65689 = ~"You got me, chief. This is all your show - I'm just following you around."~ [MO65689V]
@65692 = ~"No... you were stripped to the skins. Like I said before, looks like you got enough of a journal penned on your body."~ [MO65692V]
@65696 = ~"Nope. Still, some berk's got to know where to find him. Let's ask some of the locals."~ [MO65696V]
@65699 = ~"Yeah... a mimir's a floating encyclopedia. You put information in, you get information out."~ [MO65699V]
@65703 = ~"So? Maybe some are, but *I'm* not. And there's stranger things on the planes than that, chief."~ [MO65703V]
@65707 = ~"What's with the interrogation? What do *you* know about mimirs, anyway?"~ [MO65707V]
@65713 = ~"Okay, I'm *not* a mimir, but I know a lot of stuff, so I *might* as well be one."~ [MO65713V]
@65717 = ~"I'm a floating skull who knows a lot."~ [MO65717V]
@65722 = ~"What would YOU know about what Baator smells like?!"~ [MO65722V]
@65726 = ~"What would YOU know about what Baator smells like? Unless - hey, you've been talking about me with that tanar'ri, haven't you?! What does she know?!"~ [MO65726V]
@65730 = ~"Well, yeah, but - well, yeah. So I smell a little. *Excuse* me."~ [MO65730V]
@65732 = ~"I was in the hells for a while. Kind of a long while. The stench kind of grows on you."~ [MO65732V]
@65734 = ~"See, well, there's this *pillar* on Avernus, the first layer of Baator; it's called the Pillar of Skulls, but it's more like the pillar of heads."~ [MO65734V]
@65735 = ~"To hear some bashers tell it, it's *supposedly* made of the heads of berks, mostly sages and scholars, who used their knowing of this and knowing of that when they were alive to stretch the truth a little... so much they might have hurt, or uh, killed someone by doing it. Well, when I *died,* I ended up there. Funny, huh?"~ [MO65735V]
@65736 = ~"Eh..." Morte goes silent for a moment. "Yeah, you're right; it's not funny at all. You see, I think I knew a lot of things when I was alive. And maybe when I did know something, I didn't always tell the truth about it. I'm thinking that when I bent the truth once or twice, I may have led to someone getting penned in the dead-book sooner than they should have."~ [MO65736V]
@65741 = ~Morte looks at you for a moment. "Yeah. I can't say *how* I know it, chief, but I think so. I think you were the one that got me sent there; the last twig in the bundle before the whole load snaps. Thing is, I can't remember what happened - I don't even remember being human, or what my life was even like before I woke up on the Pillar."~ [MO65741V]
@65745 = ~"I can't say how I know it, chief, but I think it was *you.* At least once. Thing is, I can't remember what happened - I don't even remember being human, or what I was even like before I woke up on the Pillar."~ [MO65745V]
@65749 = ~"That's pretty much the way of things when you die, as I'm sure you're no stranger to. You just... forget. I figure I wasn't a sterling member of the community when I was alive... but hells, who is?" Morte sighs. "It's just that I can't help it. Nothing's worse than being *honest* all the time."~ [MO65749V]
@65752 = ~"Yeah... you're right. *Again.*" Morte clicks his teeth; the way he does it reminds you of someone drumming their fingers. "I guess just all that good and evil and lying and cheating catches up with you - and when I got penned in the dead-book, it was my turn to pay the ferryman."~ [MO65752V]
@65757 = ~"Well... you helped me, chief. When you showed up at the Pillar of Skulls, I pushed my way to the front. My obvious know-how and charm attracted your attention - you knew that *I* was the head that knew the most. So I cut a deal with you."~ [MO65757V]
@65761 = ~As Morte speaks, your vision seems to bleed into a fiery red, and you hear a howling, a horrible *screaming* tower of voices, chittering, screeching, hammering, ALL of them begging, screaming to be freed, and Morte's voice... faint, almost lost in the horde. He sounds desperate, frightened, and... pathetically, tragically *lost.*~ [MO65761V]
@65764 = ~The howling voices fall silent, and you watch the tiny, red-lined skull, its cracked features cast in a hellish light, turn its eyes up at you. Blood and ichor has streamed across its features, and its teeth chatter, as if cold. "I... I c-c-can help you. I know w-w-what you seek... all these heads... all their knowing... just please, I *beg* you, free me. Let me *help* you. I'll tell you anything, *everything.*"~ [MO65764V]
@65767 = ~"I swear. I swear... just please, *please* free me... I..." You watch as Morte sickeningly swallows, his pride almost a tangible thing. "I... *beg* you. Let me *help* you. Please."~ [MO65767V]
@65770 = ~Your vision slides, as if you are moving, and the howling, screaming cacophony begins again, a nightmarish horde of howls and cat-calls and taunts and insults... the feel of your hands sliding into the filthy quagmire of the pillar, the biting of fangs, mandibles, and your hands locking around the tiny skull and ripping, tearing it from the pillar like an old scab...~ [MO65770V]
@65773 = ~You look down at the bloody skull in your scarred hands, its eyes covered in ichor from the pillar, and its teeth chatter, once, twice. It reminds you of a wailing newborn, helpless - and in the eyes of the man you once were - pathetic.~ [MO65773V]
@65776 = ~Your vision swirls, the mists of the past drifting away, and Morte is still chattering on. "We talked for a while, chief, you and me, seeing whether the arrangement would work, and I think we both were really impressed with each other, so you invited me off the Pillar, and I've kind of been with you ever since."~ [MO65776V]
@65780 = ~"Well, I didn't know I'd lose most of the Pillar's knowledge once I was out of it... I mean, how was I to know, I'd never been off the damn thing... but you were pretty understanding about it..."~ [MO65780V]
@65784 = ~Your vision swirls again, making you dizzy, and you feel your gut churn - you hear the cracking, snapping of bone, and Morte's howls - howling in pain, screaming for someone to stop, to stop *killing* him... and your hand, lashing out, again and again and...~ [MO65784V]
@65788 = ~There is the clatter of bone against what sounds like metal - a floor or a wall, and the skittering of teeth knocked free. You can hear Morte, mewling like a beaten dog for you to st-~ [MO65788V]
@65792 = ~Your vision swirls, and Morte's cries ebb, fading into his chattering rhythm. "So, you realized I still had my uses, so I took up with you and I've been with you ever since."~ [MO65792V]
@65796 = ~Morte thinks for a moment. "Well, as for how long, I don't know the exact count, chief - ages, I suppose. I've done all I could to help you each time, but..." Morte sighs. "It's not easy. And as for what you wanted at the Pillar, I don't know - once you pried me off, I couldn't remember."~ [MO65796V]
@65800 = ~Morte suddenly becomes defensive. "Because I never *know* who you're going to be! Some of your incarnations have been stark, raving mad! One time you awoke obsessed with the idea that *I* was your skull, and chased me around the Spire trying to shatter and devour me... luckily, you were crushed by a passing cart in the street. Another, 'good and lawful,' you tried to thrust me back into the Pillar, because 'it's where I belonged.'" Morte smirks. "*That's* why. Besides, no harm's ever come of you not knowing..."~ [MO65800V]
@65804 = ~"Well, yeah, chief. I said I would. Morte always keeps his promises." He pauses. "Well, most of them. Heh-heh. There was this one chit on Arborea who-"~ [MO65804V]
@65805 = ~You suddenly realize that Morte's tone has changed - past the joke, you realize he's trying to hide something. Something about why he's with you.~ [MO65805V]
@65809 = ~"Chief, I said it's because I promised, all right?" He looks irritated. "What else could it be?"~ [MO65809V]
@65813 = ~"Well, of course not, chief, but I-" And suddenly, his tone of voice strikes a chord in you, and you know *why* he's remained with you, all this time.~ [MO65813V]
@65815 = ~"Aw, c'mon, chief. Me, feel *guilty?* I'm Morte."~ [MO65815V]
@65817 = ~Morte is silent for a moment, looking at you. "Maybe. You know what's funny? At first, I don't know what the feeling was - it kind of slowly eats at you, y'know?"~ [MO65817V]
@65818 = ~"I mean, at first I thought it was a side effect of some enchantment that 'bound' me to you... but after a couple hundred years, I realized it was *more* than that... something deeper. I just felt drawn, *connected* to you, somehow. Maybe it's all your suffering, chief... your torment. I don't know. Maybe I felt... I don't know, *responsible* for whatever it is I did. What if something I did brought you to this state?"~ [MO65818V]
@65820 = ~"Thing is, I don't think me - or whoever I was - really ever had to *see* the consequences of all the lying and cheating I'd done, and when I saw you for the first time when I was trapped on the Pillar, somehow, I *knew* that you were the one I'd betrayed. Once... long ago." Morte sighs. "And that's all I know."~ [MO65820V]
@65822 = ~"Nah, don't thank me..." Morte sighs; and to your surprise, his voice seems stronger somehow, more confident. Some of the cracks and fractures in his skull have vanished, as if healed. "Nah, the thanks is all to you - I feel like I just had a Plane moved off my shoulders... so to speak."~ [MO65822V]
@65826 = ~"Well, she's a night hag - and she was definitely barmy enough to make YOU immortal, of all people. I mean, she could have chosen me." Morte rolls his eyes. "Still, anyone addled enough to lock blades with the Lady of Pain isn't someone we really want to find."~ [MO65826V]
@65829 = ~"It's a war. A big, bloody, messy war. It happens everywhere, though you can't always see it."~ [MO65829V]
@65833 = ~"You see, chief, it's a war between two nasty races: demons and devils. Once upon a time, they didn't know about each other. The devils were evil, but it was an 'orderly' kind of evil. The demons were also evil, but they were more relaxed about it - more impulsive, more chaotic, less organized. The devils were like politicians, the demons were like butchers."~ [MO65833V]
@65834 = ~"Then one day, the two races met. They looked at each other, and they didn't like how the other race treated evil. And they've fought ever since. It's a big nightmare. But at least it keeps those two races occupied so they don't run all over the planes."~ [MO65834V]
@65837 = ~"No idea, chief. I kinda forgot when I died. Can't say I blame myself much - at least there was something waiting for me after I died, even if it is life as a floating skull. I mean, it could have been worse."~ [MO65837V]
@65838 = ~"Eh... I don't know, all right? It's just gone." Morte glares at you. "But don't think I MISS it, because I'm happy just the way I am, and I don't need your half-wit judgments or snide remarks, all right?"~ [MO65838V]
@65844 = ~Morte glares at you. "I'm not convinced you aren't some sort of walking curse that's destined to follow me around."~ [MO65844V]
@67510 = ~"I'd just like to interject here and point out that I'm not going to say anything to spoil the mood, chief. I'll just float here and watch. Don't mind me - just sitting here, floating and watching, that's me."~ [MO67510V]
@67600 = ~"Would you two cut it out before I have to get a dabus over here to separate the two of you!" Morte *hmmphs.* "Or at least allow me to cut in."~ [MO67600V]
@68172 = ~"Well, yeah - when you've been dead as long as I have, you learn to fake it really well. I've been kind of listening to your whole conversation. Use that power you got on someone else - I don't need it."~ [MO68172V]
@68173 = ~"Well, *yeah,* chief. It's not like you'd die. I mean, if you failed, you'd need someone to remember for you. Plus, you know how worthless I am in a fight - well, when I'm not taunting some mage or another..."~ [MO68173V]
@68174 = ~You reach out with your power again...~ [MO68174V]
@68310 = ~As you reach out with your power, Morte suddenly floats into the air. "Eh... hold up, chief. You don't need to resurrect me; I was uh, just kind of lying here, you know, listening to you two."~ [MO68310V]
@68312 = ~"Well, yeah, I mean I'm *already* dead and... uh, chief, what happened to your *voice?*"~ [MO68312V]
@68314 = ~"Wh-? Return me? What about *you?* Come on, chief, I may be a *coward,* but there's no way I'm leaving you in this place."~ [MO68314V]
@68316 = ~"Well, I *could* go with you anyway, chief, if you wanted me to - I mean, we've been through wors-"~ [MO68316V]
