@47816 = ~What you first took to be a door in this archway is actually a painting. The artist has made use of the shadows of the overhanging arch and some subtle texturing effects to give the door the illusion of substance.~ [PA47816V]
@47822 = ~You close your eyes, reach for the door and fumble around... to your surprise, you find a handle. With a slight tug, the door opens. A narrow passage leads into the building, and from within, you can hear distant howling.~ [PA47822V]
@47824 = ~Other than the skill of the artist, there is nothing remarkable about the painting. The "door" has been painted on a rough stone wall - you can feel the stone and mortar beneath the painted wooden texture.~ [PA47824V]
