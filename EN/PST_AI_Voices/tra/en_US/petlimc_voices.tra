@39450 = ~This is your pet Lim-Lim. Noticing it has your attention, it chirps up at you lovingly. "Piyo!"~ [PE39450V]
@42730 = ~Your Lim-Lim appears both insect and animal in origin. Its legs are oversized, but its arms are small, nearly vestigial, and a brightly speckled half-shell runs down its back. It sports twin pairs of insect-like wings, and has tiny black eyes and a mouth that always appears to be smiling gleefully.~ [PE42730V]
@42731 = ~"Piyo! Piyo!" The Lim-Lim bounces about merrily, its wings buzzing. It seems to enjoy the affection immensely.~ [PE42731V]
@42732 = ~You attempt to land a swift kick to your Lim-Lim, but it hops nimbly out of the way. "Piyo!" It turns and flees, wings buzzing.~ [PE42732V]
