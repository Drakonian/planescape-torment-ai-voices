@39448 = ~This is your pet Lim-Lim. Noticing it has your attention, it chirps up at you lovingly. "Piyo!"~ [PE39448V]
@42752 = ~Your Lim-Lim appears both insect and animal in origin. Its legs are oversized, but its arms are small, nearly vestigial, and a brightly speckled half-shell runs down its back. It sports twin pairs of insect-like wings, and has tiny black eyes and a mouth that always appears to be smiling gleefully.~ [PE42752V]
@42757 = ~"Piyo! Piyo!" The Lim-Lim squirms about merrily, its wings buzzing. It seems to enjoy the affection immensely.~ [PE42757V]
@42762 = ~You attempt to drop-kick the Lim-Lim, but it squirms out of your grasp and flies to the ground!~ [PE42762V]
