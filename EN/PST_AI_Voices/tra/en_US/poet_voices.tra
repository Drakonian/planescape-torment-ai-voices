@43386 = ~This kindly-looking old man spares you only the briefest of glances before returning to his recitation.~ [PO43386V]
@43841 = ~Your heckling, consisting of little more than cries of "Poetry stinks!" and the occasional raspberry, draws a few annoyed glances... but nothing more.~ [PO43841V]
@43843 = ~You heckle and jeer at the poet, making fun of his style of verse, appearance, and postulated home life. You draw a handful of annoyed glances and a brief, angry stare from the poet himself... but nothing more.~ [PO43843V]
@43845 = ~You heckle and jeer at the poet, making fun of his style of verse, appearance, and postulated home life. You top it off by interrupting a few of his verses and completing them with bawdy rhymes of your own, which draws some chuckles from onlookers and sets the old poet - doing his best to ignore you - to gritting his teeth.~ [PO43845V]
@43847 = ~The old poet glances at you, frowning, before returning to his recitation.~ [PO43847V]
