@38940 = ~As you open the gate, a cold wind rushes forth. You begin to shiver as you hear the sound of a voice whispering, although you cannot make out what it says. In a second, it is gone and all is silent... You realize that you have been here before, and you have a strong feeling that your companions must not follow you in.~ [PT38940V]
