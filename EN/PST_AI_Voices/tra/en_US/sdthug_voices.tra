@2933 = ~This wild-eyed man is hunched over, barking and howling at the top of his lungs. Beneath his thick, matted hair, you can make out a series of strange tattoos... they run the range from screaming faces, to bizarre geometric shapes, to what appear to be lines of verse. He is almost naked, but the dirt and filth covering him gives him the semblance of modesty.~ [SD2933V]
@2934 = ~The man whirls on you, and gives a low growl. He draws out the growl for a few seconds, then starts barking violently at you. In the distance, you can hear answering barks.~ [SD2934V]
@13745 = ~The man whirls on you as he hears your howl, then gives a lop-sided grin and he throws his head back, howling with you. He stops a few moments later, then resumes his loping about, snarling and barking like some feral dog.~ [SD13745V]
@13746 = ~The man's barking ends with a snarl, and he leaps at you!~ [SD13746V]
@13747 = ~This wild-eyed man is still loping about, barking and howling at the top of his lungs.~ [SD13747V]
