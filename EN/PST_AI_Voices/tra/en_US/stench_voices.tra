@9338 = ~This man is looking at you with a strange, bug-eyed stare. His eyes are *huge*... so huge they look ready to pop out of his sockets and roll across the cobblestones. He nods eagerly as you approach, bobbing his head like a bird... and as you near him, you suddenly notice the smell of urine and feces surrounding him.~ [ST9338V]
@9340 = ~The man sniffles, wiping his nose on his sleeve, then opens his mouth to reveal blackened, rotted gums. "Stories-for-coin, sirrah?" His breath reeks; it smells like this man has been keeping rotten meat stored inside his mouth. "Stories-for-coin?"~ [ST9340V]
