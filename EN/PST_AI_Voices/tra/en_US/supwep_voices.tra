@55077 = ~This weapon appears to be made of an unusual metal. Examining it reveals that it is constructed of one solid piece of metal rather than a blade inserted into a hilt. As you ponder this the blade begins to shift and change in your hand. It looks as if it is trying to break free of its current form.~ [SU55077V]
