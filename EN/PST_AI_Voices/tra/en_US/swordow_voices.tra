@50430 = ~The Sword of Wh'ynn - also known as the Cheater's Blade - looks more like an ornamental dagger than a combat-worthy blade. Though not particularly well balanced, it has been enchanted with powerful magicks and is thus more effective in battle than a more 'common' knife. The Sword of Wh'ynn's greatest power, however, lies in its ability to let its bearer cheat: by merely holding the 'sword' aloft in a suitably melodramatic pose, its owner will beat whatever game the artifact's been found in.~ [SW50430V]
@50438 = ~A surge of power pulses through the Sword of Wh'ynn's blade; there is the peal of thunder somewhere in the distance. In moments, the endgame is upon you...~ [SW50438V]
