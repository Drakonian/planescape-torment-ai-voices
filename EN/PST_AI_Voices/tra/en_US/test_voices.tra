@39061 = ~This was a new node, but by the time you see it it will be an old node. Da Node grew Ode! Text Text Text Words Words Words. One of these nodes is not like the other, one of these nodes is not the same...~ [TE39061V]
@42286 = ~"As you wish; you're now a THIEF."~ [TE42286V]
@42878 = ~This is a test of the...~ [TE42878V]

@46614 = ~Well all right then. We'll be testing with MORTE_DEAD today. Ready to continue?~ [TE46614V]
@46618 = ~Hey, no reason to get all bent out of shape, Just making sure. MORTE_DEAD is now 0. Next I'll set it to 1 and immediately check its value in the next node's replies.~ [TE46618V]
@46620 = ~There are two replies for this node, and only one of them should be visible. Hopefully it's the one which tells you that MORTE_DEAD is 1.~ [TE46620V]
@49156 = ~Testocles glares at you.  NOTE: This is a narrative text test. Will it work? Will it be displayed in a different color than the dialog text? It would sure make me happy.  Testocles is now back to speaking normally. That's a relief. That narrative text was just *too* intense. Uh-oh... here we go again...  NOTE: Narrative text color is activated by "NOTE:" on the beginning of a line. It will end after 2 consecutive <CR> characters. For instance, the word Salad should still be considered as part of the narrative text, even though it is a new line. SALAD - See? Make sure narrative text ends with 2 <CR>'s so this doesn't happen.  Would you like to go back to the main menu?~ [TE49156V]
@50014 = ~I'm sorry, but I am only a test character and couldn't possibly know the answer to such a question. But now you've got me curious, it is set to zero?~ [TE50014V]
@54301 = ~Then a test it shall be. I will spew forth some pointless placeholder text, which you are reading now. My lovely assistant, Test babe, will ask a few words of wisdom, and then I will finish up the interactions with a last tidbit of savory dialog.~ [TE54301V]
@54302 = ~And there you have it. A successful test of character interaction, dripping with drama and suspense. I do hope you have enjoyed our little show.~ [TE54302V]
@54304 = ~I wish I could help you, but I can't find TEST babe, my lovely assistant. If you place her next to me (via the world editor) I would be most happy to proceed with the test.~ [TE54304V]
