@45717 = ~Unlike other Collectors you've seen, the robes on this one seem to be of fine quality. "Ah, another deader has come to visit us. Please excuse the *mess;* my colleagues haven't had the time to tidy up."~ [VL45717V]
@45719 = ~Vlask chuckles softly. "You again! My friends and I very rarely get repeat business. I'll get right to the point: the price is now two hundred coppers for the key."~ [VL45719V]
@45724 = ~"Why, sure there is. The door is right over there. But you need one of these to activate the portal." He holds up what appears to be a small glass bead. "Come; let us talk price."~ [VL45724V]
@45727 = ~"Simple. You pay my comrades and me one hundred coppers. I give you the key to the portal."~ [VL45727V]
@45734 = ~"Then my friends and I will just have to sell your body to the Dustmen. Either way, we get paid."~ [VL45734V]
@45738 = ~"My comrades and myself appreciate doing business with you. Simply crushing the glass bead will activate the portal."~ [VL45738V]
@45740 = ~"Now that's a shame. Boys, prepare this one for the Dustmen."~ [VL45740V]
